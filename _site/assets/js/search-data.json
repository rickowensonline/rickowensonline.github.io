GANG AUTHORITY, COP AUTHORITY, NUN AUTHORITY. SHAPES ARE REDUCED TO THE SIMPLEST FORM SQUARE BODYSUITS, UNLINED CASHMERE TRENCHES, STRIPPED LEATHER BIKERS AND SEVERELY COLLARED TUNICS. THESE ARE BALANCED ON BOOTS AND SNEAKERS SWOLLEN TO MANGA ROBOT HERO PROPORTIONS. THERE ARE PLENTY OF SIMPLE BLACK HEAVY WOOL BROADCLOTH COATS AND TRENCHES THAT I HOPE LOOK TIMELESS. THERE WAS A METAL BAND IN THE EIGHTIES CALLED LEATHER NUN THAT DID A DARK AND HEAVY COVER OF ABBA’S “GIMME GIMME GIMME A MAN AFTER MIDNIGHT “……. I THINK THIS COLLECTION MIGHT PARTLY BE ABOUT THAT………. THE MUSIC IS AN EXCLUSIVE REMIX OF HEAVY HEAT , ONE OF RP BOO’S EARLY COMPOSITIONS, HE’S CONSIDERED ONE OF THE ORIGINATORS OF CHICAGO FOOTWORK AND HE AGREED TO DO A NEW REMIX OF IT. IN MY EYES, FOOTWORK TAKES RAP, TECHNO AND HOUSE AND BRINGS IT A CHILLY AUSTERITY BY REPETITIVE SAMPLING AND COMPLEX PERCUSSION. IT SOUNDS MODERN AND PRIMITIVE, RAW, URGENT AND DISORIENTING.

AFTER STUDYING FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT’S HOLLYHOCK HOUSE FOR YEARS, I PROPOSE THAT LIVING UP TO THAT KIND OF INTERIOR MIGHT LOOK SOMETHING LIKE THIS. FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND, SOME OF WRIGHT’S MOTIFS OF FLORA TRACED IN ANGULAR LINES HAD ITS ROOTS IN MAYAN CULTURE, AS DO I ON MY MOTHER’S SIDE. MAYBE NOW IS A GOOD TIME TO START EXPLORING THAT. BLOSSOM MOTIFS ARE ABSTRACTED INTO GEOMETRIC DIAGRAMS AND EMBROIDERED ON TUNICS OF PRISMATICALLY PATCHED MONOCHROMATIC FELTS AND FUR. BACK-FASTENED SHELLS AND MANTLES HAVE EXCESS FABRIC CASCADING DOWN THE BACK FOR A WINDBLOWN PROFILE WITH JUTTING HIPS THAT MAKE ME THINK OF THE GRACEFUL LINES OF A SEAHORSE. DRAPED AND PADDED CONFECTIONS HAVE THE EASE AND UTILITY OF A COTTON DUCK WINDBREAKER. DRAPED AND TWISTED SHIFTS COME IN LIGHTLY PADDED NYLON OR SUEDE SEAMED WITH TUFTS OF WISPY, FEATHERY FUR. ",

LAST SUMMER, MY BETTER HALF, HUN, INSTALLED BEEHIVES ON THE ROOF OF OUR HOUSE. IT’S NOT SOMETHING WE TALKED ABOUT BUT I COULD SEE SHE WAS INSTINCTIVELY RESPONDING TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES WE ALL FEEL. CHANGE CAN BE OMINOUS BUT ISN’T EVOLUTION INEVITABLE? DO WE REALLY EXPECT TO LIVE FOREVER? OR MIGHT WE GRACEFULLY GO THE WAY OF THE DINOSAUR… . OPENING A NEW STORE ON LA BREA AVE IN L.A. MADE ME REMEMBER THE LA BREA TAR PITS, PUTTING ME ON THIS TRAIN OF THOUGHT… . (THE LA BREA TAR PITS ARE A U.S. LANDMARK THAT HAVE PRESERVED THE BONES OF PREHISTORIC ANIMALS THAT WERE TRAPPED THERE THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO.) . BALANCING CONTROL AND COLLAPSE IS WHAT I’VE BUILT MY AESTHETIC ON— DISCIPLINE VS INDULGENCE, IMMORTALITY VS ITS DEFEAT, ARCHITECTURE VS WILDERNESS… I’VE BEEN ROMANTICIZING STRAIGHT LINES FOR A WHILE BUT HERE THEY’RE FRACTURED AND INCOMPLETE, LETTING AN ORGANIC ENERGY SEEP THROUGH, MOST OBVIOUSLY IN LUGUBRIOUSLY DRIPPING SPLASHES— MY VERSION OF PRIMORDIAL OOZE. FASHION’S EVOLUTION HAS EXPRESSED IDEALS OF BEAUTY THROUGH EXAGGERATION LIKE STRETCH JEANS, STILETTOS, BUSTLES AND PANNIERS… I’VE USED VOLUME AT THE PELVIS TO CONSTRUCT THE EFFECT I THINK PANNIERS WERE INTENDED FOR— TO CREATE AN IMPOSING DISPLAY FOR THE LOWER HALF OF THE BODY; A FRAME SUSPENSEFULLY COVERED WITH A CURTAIN. SHAPES IN THICK COTTON MOLESKINS AND WOOL SUITING ARE TIGHT AND CONTROLLED AT THE TOP, GRADUALLY EXPANDING AT THE HIPS TO DRAG AND MELT TREE TRUNK-LIKE INTO THE GROUND. SHEARLINGS ARE THE SIMPLEST OF SHAPES, OR TWISTED AND DRAPED INTO CASCADING BLOBS. BOMBERS ARE IN PIRARUCU— A BRAZILIAN ECO-FRIENDLY FISH HIDE WITH PREHISTORIC-LOOKING SCALES— AND PARKAS ARE CUT IN FALLING APART MOHAIR, OR BLACK SUBURBAN NYLON, TWISTED AND STRETCHED TO THE FLOOR. LOOKS ARE ANCHORED BY ADIDAS PRO MODEL SHELLTOES THAT HAVE BEEN PUMPED UP TO MASTODON LEVEL. THE DINOSAURS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE LA BREA TAR PITS ARE ECHOED IN THE SOUNDTRACK’S REFRAIN ‘I JUST THOUGHT I’D CALL BEFORE I THROW MYSELF INTO THE ICY LAKE’ (FROM ‘ICY LAKE’, A MID-NINETIES VOGUING MASTERPIECE BY DAT OVEN).

BUT IT’S ALSO A GREAT FEMINIZED SUBTITLE FOR THIS SEASON’S COLLECTION NAME, MASTODON. FOR THE MEN’S COLLECTION, THE TITLE ‘MASTODON’ REFERRED TO A COLLECTIVE UNEASINESS REGARDING ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES AND HOW GRACEFULLY EMBRACING THE INEVITABLE END OF A CYCLE MIGHT BE THE NATURAL ORDER OF THINGS. THE WOMEN’S COLLECTION CONTINUES THIS THEME OF EVOLUTION WITH SOFT ABSTRACTIONS FOLDING AROUND THE BODY IN A WAY THAT COULD REFLECT how WE MIGHT ONE DAY CALMLY FOLD INTO THE ETHER. LIKE IN A DALI PAINTING. ON AYAHUASCA. THE PRIMORDIAL SPLASHES AND DRIPS THAT WERE MORE AGGRESSIVE IN THE MEN’S COLLECTION HAVE BEEN SWEETENED HERE IN THICK CUPCAKE FROSTING EMBROIDERIES RUNNING DOWN NARROWLY CUT COATS, WHILE OTHERS ARE GRAPHICALLY SLICED WITH FIELDS OF HAPHAZARD DRAPING. THE SILK GAZARS FROM LAST SPRING HAVE BEEN INFUSED WITH WOOL TO CREATE FEATHER-LIGHT MERINO AND SILK MERINGUES. FLOATING FLANNELS AND MOHAIR CLOUDS ARE WRAPPED INTO ROBES AND TUNICS TO BE WORN OVER VELVET BOXERS-CUM-SKIRTS. THIS COLLECTION FETISHIZES A CHALLENGING GREEN I CALL CASTAING AFTER THE LEGENDARY INTERIOR DECORATOR MADELEINE CASTAING. ALTHOUGH IT WAS A TURQUOISE BLUE SHE WAS KNOWN FOR, I LIKED THIS WEIRD GREEN SHE FREQUENTLY ACCENTED IT WITH. AND HER HABIT OF WEARING A WIG HELD ON WITH AN ELASTIC CHIN STRAP HAD A COULDN’T-CARE-LESS-IN-WANING-YEARS ATTITUDE WE COULD ALL TAKE TO HEART WHEN FACING ANY KIND OF DECLINE. TUNICS WEIGHED DOWN WITH GILDED CHAINS ADD A NOTE OF PRIMITIVE GLITTER. WE’VE REISSUED OUR ADIDAS TECH RUNNER IN A THIGH-HIGH STRETCH LEATHER SOCK— A CROSS BETWEEN A SNEAKER AND AN OPERA GLOVE. AS WITH THE MEN’S, THIS COLLECTION IS LABELED WITH A ONE-TIME-ONLY OWENSCORP LABEL THAT HAS BEEN DIPPED IN THE HONEY PRODUCED BY THE BEES MY BETTER HALF, HUN, IMPULSIVELY INSTALLED ON THE ROOF OF OUR HOUSE.

NOTES . GLITTER… I CHOSE THIS NAME AS A REACTION TO THE LAST CYCLE OF MY COLLECTIONS, WHICH WERE ABOUT FACING PHYSICAL AND ECOLOGICAL DECLINE GRACEFULLY… HOW DO WE FIND THE GENTLEST WAY TO REACT TO CULTURAL AND POLITICAL THREAT? I MIGHT HAVE SUMMARIZED THAT SENSE OF DOOM WITH THE LAST FEW SHOWS AND NOW IT’S TIME TO MOVE ON. ‘GLITTER’ REFERS TO A PERIOD IN THE SEVENTIES CELEBRATING SLEAZE, TRANSGRESSION, SEXUAL LIBERATION AND ANTICONFORMITY WITH A STOMPING BOMBAST. IT WAS ABOUT AN ALMOST GROTESQUE ARTIFICE, REJECTING FEARS IN OPPRESSIVELY TROUBLING TIMES. I’M ALSO REMINDED OF FRENCH WOMEN’S HATS REACHING RIDICULOUS EXTREMES TO MOCK THEIR OCCUPIERS DURING WORLD WAR 2. ‘GLITTER’ IS ABOUT A DELIBERATE GRITTED TEETH DECISION TO CELEBRATE AND DO THE VERY BEST WITH WHATEVER YOU’VE GOT WHILE YOU CAN; AN UNHINGED DEFIANCE IN THE FACE OF TURBULENCE. I’M NOT SAYING THIS COLLECTION DOES ALL THAT, BUT IT’S IN THERE SOMEWHERE. FABRICS ARE HAND-PAINTED IN TONES CALLED ‘BEAN’ AND ‘TOAD’ — SHINY AND CHALKY. WOOLS ARE DENSE AND RIGID, JUTTING OUT AND COLLAPSING AROUND THE BODY IN STIFF FOLDS. SWEATERS ARE ENGINEERED TO HIKE UP AROUND THE MIDRIFF, CROPPING THE TORSO AND ALLOWING HIGH WAISTED PANTS TO CREATE THE FULLNESS AND SWEEP OF A WIZARD’S GOWN. SLEAZY NYLON DOWN JACKETS ARE BOUND AND WRAPPED WITH T-SHIRTS, LIKE BALLOON ANIMALS, IN BALLOON ANIMAL COLORS — DISTORTING, SWELLING AND DRAGGING. WOOL DUCHESSE BLAZERS AND NARROW COATS HAVE THEIR HACKED OFF SLEEVES REPLACED WITH TIGHT MISMATCHING KNIT TUBES TO TURN ARMS INTO LONG WANDS. DOWN-LINED CABANS ARE STRIPED WITH STRIPS OF CANVAS AND PAINT IN MUTED TONES WITH THE VOLUME OF OPERA CAPES — OPERA CAPES TO LISTEN TO MONTSERRAT CABALLÉ SINGING DALILA’S RAPTUROUS ARIA TO GAIN SAMSON’S TRUST BEFORE SHE DESTROYS HIM.

IF THE MEN’S FALL COLLECTION WAS ABOUT THE SPIRIT OF THE 70S — GLITTER AS DEFIANT FLAMBOYANCE IN REACTION TO TURBULENT TIMES — THE WOMEN’S COLLECTION, WHICH CARRIES THE SAME NAME, IS ABOUT THE GLITTER OF CIVILIZATION. AFTER PROTEST, ONE’S ATTENTION MIGHT TURN TO PERSONAL BEHAVIOR, AND MAYBE EMBRACING WHAT MAKES US CIVILIZED CAN BE OUR MOST POSITIVE ACT. CEREMONIES ARE ABOUT GROUPS AGREEING ON CODES OF BEHAVIOR AND COLLECTIVELY COMMITTING TO THEM. UNDER THE MOST CIVILIZED CIRCUMSTANCES, COMMUNITY, RESPONSIBILITY, AND KINDNESS USUALLY TOP THE LIST. I’VE ALWAYS THOUGHT OF RUNWAY SHOWS AS CONTEMPORARY CEREMONIES. HOW CAN WE USE THEM IN THE MOST POSITIVE WAY? I’M NOT SAYING I HAVE THE ANSWER TO THAT BUT ASKING THAT QUESTION IS THE DIRECTION I WOULD LIKE TO GO. MITRES, CROWNS, AND VEILS ARE FASHIONED FROM FADED T-SHIRTS AND SWEATSHIRTS; LONG CLOAKS, ROBES, AND CAPES ARE PATCHED TOGETHER FROM PAINTED CANVAS, THICK WOOL MELTON, COWHIDE, AND RAW COTTONS. THIS SUGGESTS AN IMPROVISED PERSONAL SENSE OF FORMALITY AND RITUAL — ARTE POVERA GOWNS TO WEAR IN MICHAEL HEIZER’S CITY. COATS AND JACKETS ARE EXTENDED WITH WOOLLY BLOBS AND BUTTRESSES WITH SKINNY KNIT SLEEVES EXTENDING TO THE KNEES. DUVETS ARE TWISTED AND KNOTTED AROUND THE BODY AND THEN REPEATED IN NUTRIA AND PEKAN FUR; ROBES PEEL OFF THE BODY AND EXTEND OUT IN CRUMPLED FORMATIONS THAT EXAGGERATE THE PELVIS. DEEPLY SLIT GOWNS IN PAINTED CANVAS OR SILK MEGA DUCHESSE ARE WORN OVER CASHMERE KNIT BOXERS AND TANKS. SHOES ARE STRETCH SOCK RUNNERS WHICH ARE MY VERSION OF AN OPERA GLOVE COMBINED WITH A SNEAKER. I WEAR MINE UP TO COVER MY KNEES DURING THE DAY AND SCRUNCHED DOWN AT THE GYM.

IT’S DRAINING TO WATCH UNHEALTHY CYCLES REPEAT THEMSELVES, BEHAVIOURALLY AND HISTORICALLY, AND EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE, IT’S HARD TO SUPRESS A HOWL OF RAGE. IF WE HAVEN’T LEARNED BETTER BY NOW, AFTER ALLLLL THIS TIME, DOES THIS MEAN UNHEALTHY CYCLES AND BASE URGES ARE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE HUMAN CONDITION? AND IF THEY ARE INTEGRAL, DOES THAT MEAN THEY HAVE SOME KIND OF HORRIBLE VALUE? RENDING ONE’S CLOTHES IN ANGER HAS A DRAMATICALLY BIBLICAL SOUND — HERE THESE CLOTHES ARE RENT IN A BIT MORE OF A DELIBERATE AND PERHAPS FATALISTIC WAY. DOUBLE KNIT TUNICS IN MERCERIZED COTTON FACED WITH CASHMERE WE REFER TO AS ‘CASHBOARD’ ARE SLIT AND SLASHED TO HANG AND GAPE AROUND THE BODY… OR CUT IN THIN AND CRISP WRAPPED JACKETS THAT CAN BE USED AS LAYERS UNDER COATS. HAPHAZARD CARGO CHAPS ARE CUT IN CAMEL HAIR FLANNEL TO MATCH HIGH WAISTED PANTS CUT WITH A CUMMERBUND SILHOUETTE… AND RAW DARK DENIM JEANS HAVE BEEN CHOPPED INTO JAGGED SKIRTS. COATS AND SHOES ARE CONSTRUCTED IN A PLASTIC SHEARLING THAT TRAILS LOOSE FILAMENTS IN AN OUT-OF-CONTROL HAZE AND SOME COATS HAVE BEEN HAND-PAINTED IN ROUGH THICK BRUSHSTROKES. CHAINS CAN SUGGEST SUBORDINATION BUT THEY CAN ALSO REPRESENT LINKED STRENGTH. HERE THEY ARE DRAPED AND WRAPPED AROUND THE BODY AS STRAPS ON THE SIMPLEST OF RAW CUT PORTFOLIO ZIPPED BAGS IN SOFT SUEDE OR RIGID COWHIDE. FLAGS CAN BE ABOUT UNITY AND PRIDE BUT ALSO DIVISIVENESS… HERE THEY ARE RENDERED AS CAPED PANELS FLOATING OUTWARDS AT THE BACK OF LONG COATS IN SOMBRE WOOL FELTS AND NYLON DUCHESSE. THE SOUNDTRACK IS A REMIX OF ‘ENERGIZE’ BY DJ SPEEDLAP, THE KIND OF 90S TERROR TECHNO I LISTEN TO EVERY DAY AS A SAFETY VALVE TO RELEASE THE IMPATIENCE AND FRUSTRATION THAT ARE THE PERSONAL CYCLES I CAN’T SEEM TO CONTROL, NO MATTER HOW MUCH I SHOULD HAVE LEARNED BETTER TO BY NOW. IF, AFTER ALL MY EFFORTS, I HAVEN’T FOUND A WAY TO ERASE THEM, DOES THAT MEAN THEY SERVE SOME KIND OF PURPOSE? . ",

NOTES . THIS WOMEN’S FALL/WINTER COLLECTION FOLLOWS THE MEN’S FALL/WINTER COLLECTION IN BEING TITLED SISYPHUS AFTER THE ARROGANT KING IN GREEK MYTHOLOGY WHO WAS PUNISHED BY ZEUS TO REPEATEDLY ROLL A BOULDER UP A HILL ONLY TO HAVE IT ROLL BACK DOWN AGAIN. ETERNALLY. WE MIGHT INTERPRET THIS AS A STORY ABOUT FUTILITY, OR AS A STORY OF PATTERNS MONOTONOUSLY REPEATING THEMSELVES WITHOUT PROGRESSION. FOR THE MEN’S SHOW I WAS FOCUSED ON CYCLES OF CULTURAL BACKPEDALING AND DISAPPOINTING SOCIAL SHIFTS BUT FOR THE WOMEN’S SHOW THE FOCUS IS ON SEDUCTION. CLOTHES ARE COMMUNICATION AND THE MESSAGE IS OFTEN ONE OF SEDUCTION. BUT TOWARDS WHAT RESULTS? . IN THE PAST THERE HAVE BEEN MOMENTS OF ALMOST GROTESQUE PHYSICAL DISTORTION IN THE NAME OF SEDUCTION — PANNIERS, BUSTLES… IT’S BEEN A WHILE SINCE THIS KIND OF DELIBERATELY SLY EXAGGERATION WAS EMBRACED. ALTHOUGH THE BULBOUS BAGS AND BACKPACKS IN MY RECENT COLLECTIONS CAN EASILY READ ‘REFUGEE’, I HAVE PRINCIPALLY DEPLOYED THEM AS EXCUSES TO CREATE CREDIBLE VOLUMES ON THE BODY. PADDING HERE ISN’T NECESSARILY ABOUT PROTECTION, BUT ABOUT VOLUPTUOUSNESS AND A CRUDE SUMPTUOUSNESS. TUNICS IN CAMEL HAIR AND LINEN FELT ARE PACKED WITH GOOSE DOWN TO SWADDLE AND ENVELOP THE BODY IN UNEVEN INDENTATIONS AND EXTENSIONS TO ABSTRACT THE FIGURE. COLORS ARE MUTED AND BLEAK. COATS, MANTLES, AND MEGAPARKAS ARE WORN OVER CASHMERE RUNNING SHORTS PAIRED WITH GENERIC LOOKING TRACK SHOES . OVERSIZED WORK SHIRTS, CARGOCHAPS, AND SHOES ARE CONSTRUCTED IN A SYNTHETIC SHEARLING THAT TRAILS LOOSE FILAMENTS OF RECYCLED POLYESTER YARN IN AN OUT-OF-CONTROL HAZE AND SOME COATS AND T-SHIRTS HAVE BEEN HAND-PAINTED IN ROUGH, THICK RESIN BRUSHSTROKES. COATS ARE PIECED AND PATCHED TOGETHER IN COMPOSITIONS RIPPING OFF BAUHAUS ARCHITECTURE, WITH DEEP NUTRIA-LINED PATCH POCKETS. THE ARTE POVERA SEDUCTION PROPOSED HERE IS A RAW AND INDIRECT ONE. SOME MAY CALL IT ANTI- SEDUCTION. BUT WHAT ARE THE SEDUCTION RULES AND WHOSE AUTHORITY DO I ACCEPT IN DEFINING THEM? . THE MUSIC ACCOMPANYING THIS SHOW IS SEVERAL VERSIONS OF A 1950S SHOW TUNE ‘BAUBLES, BANGLES AND BEADS’, A SONG ABOUT DRESSING, SEDUCTION, AND EXPECTATIONS. THE WISTFUL, YEARNING LYRICS CAN STRIKE A CHORD BECAUSE WE CAN ALL IDENTIFY, WHILE WE ALSO SMILE RUEFULLY AT ITS SIMPLISTIC MESSAGE IN THESE COMPLICATED TIMES (I HAVE ALWAYS DEFINED CAMP AS A CYNICS EXCUSE TO EMBRACE SENTIMENTALITY).

    "content": "NOTES . FW19 LARRY — NAMED FOR LARRY LEGASPI WHOM I HAVE JUST FINISHED A BOOK ON, BEING RELEASED IN OCTOBER WHEN THIS COLLECTION WILL BE IN STORES. LARRY WAS THE MAN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SILVER AND BLACK SPACE-SLEAZE LOOKS OF LABELLE AND KISS IN THE SEVENTIES. HE INTRODUCED A CAMP FEROCITY TO THE MAINSTREAM AND HELPED SET A LOT OF KIDS LIKE ME FREE, WITH HIS MIX OF ART DECO SEXUAL AMBIGUITY AND RAW, BLACK LEATHER BOMBAST. THERE WAS A SWEATY ELEGANCE TO HIS VISION THAT HAS STAYED WITH ME. LARRY’S LIGHTNING BOLT MOTIF WHICH TRACED THE THIGHS OF KISS GUITARIST ACE FREHLEY’S ORIGINAL JUMPSUIT IS USED AS A CHARM DANGLING FROM BAGS, POUCHES, AND DUFFLES LONG ENOUGH TO BE WORN AS LEATHER CAPES. A BLACK AND SILVER DEGRADE PRINT IS FEATURED ON DUVET COATS, SCARVES, AND LEATHER JUMPSUITS — A NARROW ELASTIC-WAISTED VERSION OF MY REGULAR JUMBO BODYBAG. WE ALSO PRESENT THE DEGRADE PRINT IN BLEACHED FUCHSIA DENIM. SNAP CROTCH MAILLOTS IN THIN COTTON RIB OR STRETCH LEATHER ARE WORN IN LAYERS OR UNFASTENED OVER TANK TOPS — SEX CONFRONTATION INSTEAD OF SEXY COYNESS. THEY ARE WORN ALONE, OR OVER SLIT FRONT NARROW CASHMERE KNIT SKIRTS. KNIT DRESSES ARE SLIT, FLANGED, AND TORQUED TO TWIST AND DRAPE AROUND THE BODY. COLLECTION COLORS ARE IN WARM TONES OF SOFT GREY, CHERRY RED, BLONDE, FUCHSIA, AND MAHOGANY. THE BODY IS STRETCHED OUT BY PLATFORM BOOTS ON ONE END AND A HIGH, SHARP SHOULDER ON THE OTHER. MORE NOSTALGIC THAN I USUALLY GO FOR, BUT THIS 1970S VIBE REMINDS ME OF AN ERA THRILLED WITH POTENTIAL LIBERATION AS OPPOSED TO OUR CURRENT ONE THAT SOMETIMES FEELS SULLENLY ENTITLED… . CASHMERE COATS ARE SPLICED WITH RAW SILVER FUR COWHIDE AND PATCHED WITH SOFT PADDED NYLON CARGO POCKETS. THEY ARE CUT WITH A BAUHAUS SHOULDER THAT COMES FROM THE MOVIE METROPOLIS — A 1930S FUTURISTIC EPIC REFERENCED BY LARRY IN HIS WORK, AS WELL AS IN MINE. I HAVE ALSO KNOCKED OFF A CHARLES JAMES COCOON COAT AND REINTERPRETED IT IN RAW-SEAMED SHEARLING, NUTRIA, AND DUVET. LARRY ADMIRED JAMES AND SHARED MODELS IN 1970S N.Y. WITH HIM… I JUST WROTE THE INTRO TO A NEW CHARLES JAMES BOOK OUT IN MARCH — CHARLES JAMES, THE COUTURE SECRETS OF SHAPE — THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE CHARLES JAMES BOOK I HAVE EVER READ, WITH ALL NEW IMAGERY AND INFORMATION CONTRIBUTED BY HOMER LAYNE, JAMES’ LONG TIME ASSISTANT. I HAVE MOUNTED AN EXHIBITION OPENING AFTER THIS SHOW. I HAVE ALWAYS CITED MARIANO FORTUNY AS AN INFLUENCE AND ALWAYS DELIGHT IN PASSING THE ORIGINAL FORTUNY FACTORY ON GIUDECCA WHEN I TAKE THE FERRY TO MY SUMMER STUDIO ON THE VENICE LIDO. FORTUNY ALLOWED ME TO PULL PRINTS FROM THEIR ARCHIVES AND THEY EXCLUSIVELY PRINTED MY SIGNATURE ANGORA VISCOSE JERSEY WITH THEM, WHICH I HAVE DRAPED IN ROPES OF FABRIC ECHOING THE WAY THE ORIGINAL PLEATED SILK FORTUNY DRESSES WERE STORED. WE’VE REISSUED OUR SHIELD SUNGLASSES IN RED AND YELLOW, AND I’VE KNOCKED OFF MY CHEAP GIFT SHOP SNOWBOARDER SUNGLASSES THAT I HAD FITTED WITH MY READING PRESCRIPTION… AND TURNED THEM BACK INTO SUNGLASSES… . MAKEUP IS DESIGNED BY SALVIA, A LEADER IN PUSHING THE BODY MODIFICATION AESTHETIC WHICH HAS REPLACED TATTOOS FOR THIS GENERATION. THIS IS OUR NEW DIAMOND DOGS GLAMOUR. MUSIC IS AN EXTENDED REMIX OF ‘INFINITE’ BY LAVASCAR — MY BEAUTIFUL WIFE MICHELE LAMY’S BAND WITH NICO VASCELLARI, AND HER DAUGHTER, SCARLETT ROUGE (LAMY/VASCELLARI/SCARLETT), PRODUCED BY ROCCO RAMPINO. IN THIS SONG, MICHELE RECITES WORDS BY ETEL ADNAN, THE LEBANESE/AMERICAN POET. ",

NOTES . Z PERFORMA IS A PERFORMANCE ART BIENNIAL CREATED BY ROSELEE GOLDBERG IN 2004 THAT HAS COMMISSIONED AND FEATURED PERFORMANCES BY HUNDREDS OF ARTISTS INCLUDING MARINA ABRAMOVIĆ, MIKE KELLEY, AND RASHID JOHNSON. THE ROMANCE OF JOSEPH BEUYS’ AKTIONS AT DOCUMENTA IN THE SEVENTIES ALWAYS THRILLED ME AND, IN MY HEAD, PERFORMA IS THE EVOLUTION OF THAT. THIS YEAR, HUN SOMEHOW WOUND UP PERFORMING IN IT AS A MEMBER OF CECILIA BENGOLEA’S DANCE GROUP. SEEING HUN FOLLOW HER INSTINCTS TO PERFORM MADE ME CONSIDER MY OWN; I HAD ALWAYS REGARDED PERSONAL BEHAVIOR, SOCIAL AND MORAL, AS SOMETHING TO QUIETLY BUT DILIGENTLY WORK ON IMPROVING. BUT AT 58, I FIND MYSELF, FOR BETTER OR WORSE, PERFORMING. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BEHAVIOR AND PERFORMANCE IMPLIES FALSENESS AND REHEARSAL IN THE LATTER. BUT MAYBE CONCENTRATION ON BEHAVIOR CAN BE A BIT PASSIVELY DRY? AND PERFORMANCE A JOYOUS CONTRIBUTION? LIKE COMPETITIVE SPORT OR ORCHESTRA CONDUCTING? ( SHOUT-OUT TO CURRENT FAVE, TEODOR CURRENTZIS). OUR INSTAGRAM GENERATION MAKES REFINING BEHAVIOR VS INDULGING IN PERFORMANCE A WEIRD NEW BALANCING ACT… AS A RESULT, THERE IS A HEAVY DOSE OF THEATER IN THIS COLLECTION— SHOULDERS ARE MONSTROUS AND ARMS EXTENDED AND EXTRA SPINDLY. THERE ARE GARISH SNAKESKINS, LEOPARD-PRINTED SATINS AND BLEACHED SEAWOLF PATCHWORK… BUT THESE ARE JUST FLOURISHES DUSTING A COLLECTION THAT IS PREDOMINANTLY MUTED IN GRAY CASHMERES IN MULTIPLE WEIGHTS DRAPED AND WRAPPED GENTLY AROUND THE BODY. CASHMERE KNITS IN GRAY AND BLUE ARE PEELED UP AND DOWN LEGS, ARMS, AND TORSOS, REVEALING THIN DRAPED T-SHIRTS BENEATH… SOME KNITS ARE TRACED IN LINEAR GRAPHICS SIMILAR TO WHAT KANSAI YAMAMOTO DID FOR BOWIE IN THE SEVENTIES (THIS COLLECTION IS VERY KANSAI/BEUYS…). THESE ARE WORN UNDER SEAMLESSLY CONSTRUCTED TRANSLUCENT VINYL HOODED COATS… AND DOUBLE FACED CASHMERE ROBES AND MANTLES. TAILORING COMES IN CROPPED FELTED JACKETS WITH A HIGH SHARP SHOULDER OR HULKING BLANKET COATS MIMICKING LE CORBUSIER’S MODULOR MAN. THERE ARE SWISHY SATIN PYJAMAS OR BIKER LOOKS IN BLACK LEATHER OR BRIGHT BLUE PIRARUCU. SHOES ARE EITHER SWAGGERING PLATFORMS WITH METAL TOE GUARDS AND TRANSPARENT HEELS, OR RUNNERS FROM OUR CONTINUING COLLAB WITH SUSTAINABILITY CHAMPIONS VEJA, IN BRIGHT RUST AND YELLOW THIS SEASON. MUSIC IS A COMPOSITION BY VOGUING MASTER MIKEQ THAT I HAD COMMISSIONED FOR THE POMPIDOU PERFORMANCE WE DID IN OCTOBER— WANTED TO MAKE SURE WE MILKED IT. THERE WAS A FRENCH 1930S CABARET PERFORMER NAMED CÉCILE SOREL WHO WOULD MAKE HER ENTRANCE WALKING DOWN A LONG STAIRCASE AND WHEN SHE REACHED THE BOTTOM WOULD ASK THE AUDIENCE “HOW WELL DID I DESCEND?” I USED THIS PHRASE AS THE TITLE TO THE ONLY BOOK I THOUGHT I WOULD EVER WRITE… SINCE THEN I HAVE DONE 4… .

NOTES . HI GARY NUMAN, RICK OWENS HERE CONTACTING YOU WITH GREAT RESPECT. I’M A FASHION DESIGNER IN PARIS AND HAVE A WOMEN’S RUNWAY SHOW COMING UP FEBRUARY 27. THE CLOTHES HAVE A VAGUELY GRAY BAUHAUS/KLAUS NOMI VIBE AND I SAW THEM WALKING TO YOUR SONG ‘DOWN IN THE PARK’. IT OCCURRED TO ME YOU MIGHT CONSIDER LENDING A PERSONAL TOUCH — LIKE LETTING ME USE SOME OF THE ORIGINAL TRACKS SO I COULD HAVE A SUPER MINIMAL STRIPPED DOWN VERSION, SIGNALING YOUR PRESENCE AND APPROVAL. I REALIZE THIS IS SHAMELESSLY CHEEKY AND YOU HAVE MORE CURRENT THINGS TO DO THAT ARE OF MUCH MORE INTEREST TO YOU… I KNOW THAT I MIGHT BE BORED TO REVISIT SOMETHING I HAD CREATED DECADES AGO… BUT LET ME JUST SAY THAT THE MOMENT I WANT TO CELEBRATE IS THAT OF A SMALL TOWN SISSY IN 1979 FINDING STRENGTH IN THE CHILLY DOOMED GLAMOUR YOU CREATED WITH THAT SONG AND I WANT TO RECREATE IT AS A 58-YEAR-OLD MAN AT THE PEAK OF HIS ALL TOO NUMBERED POWERS. IS THIS SOMETHING YOU MIGHT CONSIDER? . IN DEEP ADMIRATION RICK GARY SAID YES. HIS PERFORMANCES AS AN ALIENATED WITNESS TO A DYSTOPIAN WORLD IN THE 80S WAS ONE OF THE FOUNDATIONS OF MY PERSONAL AESTHETIC — HIS WAS A CLINICAL AND CALCULATED ARTIFICE THAT GAZED DISPASSIONATELY ON THE BANALITY OF A DECAYING WORLD; PERFECT FOR NOW. THERE IS A HEAVY DOSE OF THEATRICAL ARTIFICE IN THIS COLLECTION — SHOULDERS ARE MONSTROUS AND ARMS EXTENDED AND EXTRA SPINDLY. PILLED KNIT SLEEVES SWALLOW GIANT SHOULDER PADS. THERE ARE GARISH LEOPARD-PRINTED SATINS, OPALESCENT LEATHERS AND BRIGHT BLUE PIRARUCU… BUT THESE ARE JUST FLOURISHES DUSTING A COLLECTION THAT IS PREDOMINANTLY MUTED IN GRAY CASHMERES IN MULTIPLE WEIGHTS DRAPED AND WRAPPED GENTLY AROUND THE BODY.

THESE ARE WORN UNDER COATS MADE OF RECYCLED PLASTIC WITH BONDED SEAMS — THIGH HIGH BOOTS HAVE MULTIPLE ZIPPED POCKETS AND COME IN RECYCLED PLASTIC, OPALESCENT LEATHER, OR ACID-HUED SEAWOLF. TAILORING COMES IN SLIM COATS WITH A HIGH, SHARP SHOULDER, DIAMOND-SILHOUETTED COATS WITH MEGA WIDE SHOULDERS, OR HULKING BLANKET COATS AND BOMBERS MIMICKING LE CORBUSIER’S MODULOR MAN. LONG SATIN GOWNS PROVIDE SLASHES OF COLOR HELD TOGETHER WITH THE BAREST OF TIES AT THE SIDE. DUVETS MADE IN COLLABORATION WITH MONCLER ARE WORN AS CAPES — THESE WERE PART OF THE INTERIOR OF A CUSTOMIZED BUS I DID WITH THEM TO TAKE HUN AND MYSELF ON A ROAD TRIP THROUGH THE NEVADA DESERT ON A LAND ART TOUR — THE BUS WAS OUR PERSONAL GRAY INSULATED CAPSULE TRAVELING THROUGH AREA 51.

JKTS AND COATS IN LEATHER AND SHEARLING THAT SEAL THE BODY WITH INTEGRATED GLOVES AND ZIP UP OVER THE FACE SPEAK OF PROTECTION AND WITHDRAWAL. HORROR. SKIN TIGHT LEATHER BODYSUITS UNDERPIN MOST LOOKS, SOME WITH THE TOP PULLED DOWN TO HANG OFF THE HIPS. SHARP, EXAGGERATED SHOULDERS ON TAILORED COATS AND CROPPED BOMBERS MOCK MALE CONSERVATISM CAREENING OFF THE RAILS. HEAVY RECYCLED CASHMERE SWEATERS TWIST AROUND THE BODY – THEY CAN PULL UP TO DOUBLE OR PEEL DOWN TO TRAIL OFF THE BODY. THE SAME YARNS ARE USED TO KNIT ROOMY BLANKET- SIZED HOODED ROBES. BIBLICAL. THESE HOODED ROBES ARE REPEATED IN DUVET WHICH ALSO COMES IN CROPPED JKTS PEELING OFF THE TORSO. TIGHTY-WHITIES WITH PENTAGRAM FLYS ADD MORE UNHINGED MALE ENERGY WHEN WORN WITH THIGH HIGH COWHIDE FUR BOOTS – WITH A PLATFORM HEEL OR A BALLAST SOLE – UNDER COATS MADE FROM RECYCLED PLASTIC WASTE WITH THE SLEEVES RIPPED OFF.

THE RAMONES WERE ALWAYS ONE OF MY FAVORITE BANDS – LOUD AND DUMB CAN ALSO BE CONCISE AND ELEGANT… THEY HAD THE WHOLE PACKAGE – THE RIGHT ATTITUDE, THE RIGHT CHORDS, THE RIGHT HIP BONES, THE RIGHT GRAPHICS, THE RIGHT HAIR, AND THE RIGHT SHOES – CONVERSE. YEARS AGO, I DID MY OWN DUMBER AND LOUDER VERSION OF THESE SNEAKERS AND THIS SEASON CONVERSE AGREED TO GRAFT MY CRUDE VERSION ONTO THEIR ORIGINAL AND MUTATE THEIR SIGNATURE TOE CAP. THE TONGUE IS EXTENDED AND THE LABEL AND LICENSE PLATES ARE ALTERED TO REFLECT THE DRKSHDW COLLABORATION.

WE’VE ALL BEEN LIVING A TENSE PERIOD IN HISTORY WAITING FOR A RESOLUTION, BE IT CATASTROPHIC OR RATIONAL, IN A SUSPENSE THAT FEELS ALMOST BIBLICAL IN ITS DRAMA. MY GARDEN IS THE BEACH IN FRONT OF MY HOME ON VENICE’S LIDO. MY PANDEMIC RUNWAY SHOWS HAVE ALL BEEN ON THE LIDO — A 2-HOUR DRIVE FROM MY FACTORY IN CONCORDIA AND A SMALLER FOOTPRINT, PARED-DOWN, NO AUDIENCE, HOME-BASED MOOD THAT FEELS SUITABLE FOR THE MOMENT. THIS REDUCTION IN IMPORTED HAIR AND MAKEUP AND PRODUCTION ARMIES HAS ALLOWED THESE SHOWS TO TURN INTO PRIVATE CEREMONIES SHARED BY OUR SMALL CONCORDIA TEAM FROM CONCEPTION TO CLIMAX, ALLOWING US TO CONNECT IN A WHOLE NEW WAY AFTER 15 YEARS OF PARIS SHOWS. SKIN-TIGHT LEATHER BODYSUITS UNDERPIN MOST LOOKS, SOME WITH THE TOP PULLED DOWN TO HANG OFF THE HIPS. SOME ARE SOLIDLY SEQUINED. I’VE BEEN FEATURING BODYSUITS FOR SOME SEASONS NOW, ORIGINALLY AS MONUMENTALLY IMPOSING STIFF VOLUMES BUT GRADUALLY REDUCING TO THEIR CURRENT INCARNATION — SELF-CONTAINED AND SEALED BODY COVERINGS LIKE AN UPHOLSTERED GEAR SHIFT KNOB. THESE ARE TOPPED BY POWER SHOULDER CAPES THAT TURN THE BODY INTO ARCHITECTURAL BULLDOZERS, OR POWER SHOULDER BOMBERS MOCKING MALE AGGRESSION AND CONSERVATISM CAREENING OFF THE RAILS THAT WAS THE FOCUS OF MY MEN’S SHOW IN JANUARY — COINCIDING WITH THE SHOCKING EVENTS IN WASHINGTON. THESE SHOULDERS ARE A RESPONSE TO FEAR AND ANXIETY; DEFIANCE IN THE FACE OF THREAT. I HAVE SHOWN MASKS WITH THESE PANDEMIC SHOWS NOT BECAUSE MY MASKS ARE GUARANTEED PROTECTION, BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE A VOTE FOR RESPONSIBILITY AND CONSIDERATION AND AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF OUR IMMEDIATE COLLECTIVE EXPERIENCE. TAILORED JKTS MADE FROM RECYCLED PLASTIC WASTE ARE CROPPED WITH THE SLEEVES RIPPED OFF AND REPLACED WITH JUMBO DUVET SNAP-ON SLEEVES. IN THE BIBLE, THE RENDING OF ONES GARMENTS IS AN ACT OF GRIEF OR RAGE — TO VIOLENTLY TEAR THE CLOTHES ONE IS WEARING APART. THIS IS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SLASHED BLACK DENIM PIECES IN THE COLLECTION, MIRRORED IN THE SLASHED GRAPHICS RENDERED IN BY- PRODUCT SHEARLINGS AND COWHIDES PATCHWORKED INTO COATS AND JACKETS. NARROW BACKLESS LONG-SLEEVED SHEATH GOWNS ARE CUT IN HEAVY VISCOSE KNIT, SEQUINS, OR BLACK OVERDYED DENIM. LIKE THE BODYSUITS, THEIR TOPS ARE OFTEN PULLED DOWN TO HANG OFF THE HIPS AND WORN WITH A T-SHIRT. RUCHED AND SEQUINED THONGS ARE WORN OVER RECYCLED CASHMERE BODYSUITS TO ADD A LURID FLOURISH TO MATTER-OF-FACT AND PRACTICAL MODESTY. THESE RECYCLED CASHMERE YARNS ARE ALSO KNIT INTO HEAVY SWEATERS, PULLED UP TO DOUBLE ON THE TORSO, AND ROOMY BLANKET-SIZED HOODED ROBES. BIBLICAL. THESE HOODED ROBES ARE REPEATED IN TENT-SIZED DUVET OR SEQUIN ENCRUSTED DENIM. THE PENTA-BRIEFS FROM THE LAST MEN’S SHOW THAT SPOKE OF UNHINGED MALE AGGRESSION ARE WRAPPED AROUND SIMPLE COWHIDE ENVELOPES TO BE WORN AS A WOMAN’S EVENING CLUTCH. HEAVY WORK SHIRTS WORN OVER GOWNS COME IN 16OZ BLACK WARP/BLACK WEFT/BLACK SELVEDGE DENIM CUSTOM WOVEN FOR US BY YAMAASHI ORIMONO (EST. 1945) ON VINTAGE SAKAMOTO SHUTTLE LOOMS. THIS IS FROM AN ONGOING DRKSHDW CAPSULE MADE IN JAPAN. SOUNDTRACK IS AN EXCLUSIVE EXTENDED REMIX OF ‘SQUEEZE’ BY GHOSTEMANE, WHO ALSO SOUNDTRACKED OUR LAST MEN’S SHOW THAT SPOKE ABOUT MALE SUPPRESSED RAGE ON EVERY SIDE OF THE MORAL DIVIDE… BUT OF COURSE, SUPPRESSED RAGE IS NOT EXCLUSIVELY MALE.

NOTES . IN THIS AGE OF IMMEDIATE GRATIFICATION AND META-SELF-INVENTION MORE THAN EVER BEFORE, MAYBE INDULGING MY ID IS ULTIMATELY THE WISEST PATH. THE LANGUOROUS GLAMASLEAZY LIGHT SEEKERS IN THIS COLLECTION REFLECT THAT MOOD. OUR DRELLA COATS (DRELLA BEING WARHOL’S NICKNAME COINED BY DISCIPLE ONDINE) CAN BE BELTED AROUND THE HIPS OR, WITH THE UNBUTTONING OF A BACK SLIT, BE THROWN OVER THE HEAD AS A PONCHO OR A CAPE. THEDA BARA PARKAS WITH EXTRAVAGANT GOAT HAIR TRIM COME IN BLACK LEATHER, ORANGE CANVAS, OR REFLEX — AN INDUSTRIALLY FAMILIAR RETROFLECTIVE FABRIC WOVEN WITH YARN MADE FROM GLASS. TAILORED COATS AND JACKETS STILL HAVE EXAGGERATED SHOULDERS THAT I HAD STARTED DOING AS A PARODY OF MASCULINITY BUT ENDED UP ENJOYING WEARING… AN EXCUSE TO TAKE UP MORE SPACE AROUND ME. CAMP HAS ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT EXAGGERATING EARNESTLY NAIVE URGES… DUVET COATS COME WITH FULLY ZIPPED HOODS WITH EYE HOLES TO FURTHER THE TIMELESS TRADITION OF OUT-MENACE-ING OUR MENACERS. OUR EYE HAS GOTTEN USED TO A MASKED FACE. PATCHWORKED SHEARLINGS COME FROM A FAMILY-OWNED, SECOND GENERATION TANNERY FROM TUSCANY. THEY ARE LWG [LEATHER WORKING GROUP] CERTIFIED, WHICH COVERS ENVIRONMENTAL, TRACEABILITY, AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY. SLEEVELESS OVERSHIRTS TO BE WORN UNDER CROPPED, WIDE-SHOULDERED BOMBERS OR LAYERED UNDER OVERCOATS HAVE DEEP ZIPPED INTERNAL POCKETS THAT ACT AS MEGA WALLETS. HELMETS HAVE DAN FLAVIN-ESQUE FLUORESCENT BULBS SET IN CROWN SHAPES THAT I KEPT SEEING IN THE EGYPTIAN TEMPLES AND TOMBS I TOURED LAST OCTOBER. THEY ARE BALANCED OUT BY OUR NEW BLOWN-UP CONVERSE TURBOWPN AND DRKSTAR OR KNEE- HIGH PULL ON BOOTS WITH EITHER A LUG SOLE OR OUR BELOVED ACRYLIC-HEELED PLATFORMS. COTTON SILK DUCHESSE — WOVEN IN THE COMO REGION OF ITALY. SUPER HIGH THREAD COUNT THAT MAKES THE MATERIAL VERY COMPACT AND RIGID. 500 GRAMS. WOVEN ON AN ARTISANAL SLOW LOOM. BONOTTO CANVAS WOOL — WOVEN ON AN EARLY 20TH CENTURY SHUTTLE LOOM WITH A LOW WIDTH AND NATURAL SELVEDGE. FROM THE VENETO REGION OF ITALY. MILL IS FOURTH GENERATION, FOUNDED IN 1912, AND BELIEVES IN TRADITIONAL OLD WEAVING TECHNIQUES WHICH THEY COIN ‘SLOW WEAVING’. 100% OF OUR COTTON JERSEYS ARE ORGANIC GOTS CERTIFIED COTTON. 90% OF OUR COTTON WOVENS ARE ORGANIC CERTIFIED COTTON. I DON’T MENTION ALL THIS OUT OF VIRTUOUSNESS, WE DEFINITELY HAVE ROOM TO IMPROVE. I JUST LIKE PROMOTING THE CONVERSATION FASHION IS HAVING ABOUT RESPONSIBILITY. BUT THE PERFECT BALANCE OF VIRTUOUSNESS AND CHEERFUL DEGENERACY HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY HOLY GRAIL; THE DEGENERACY HERE ENHANCED BY THE SISTERS OF MERCY’S DRONING ‘LIGHTS’, AN ANTHEM I PLAYED OVER AND OVER IN MY MISSPENT YOUTH. I REACHED OUT TO ANDREW ELDRITCH ABOUT REMIXING THIS SONG, BUT HE PREFERRED I CHOOSE ANOTHER AS HE HAD NEVER BEEN HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCTION RELEASED. I TOTALLY UNDERSTOOD — I DON’T KNOW IF THE IMAGE I WILL LEAVE BEHIND IS EXACTLY WHAT I PLANNED. BUT I THINK PEOPLE TRUST A CREATIVE EXPRESSION AT ITS MOST RAW AND SINCERE STATE AND RETAIN AND CHERISH IT. I HOPE HE WILL FORGIVE MY FINAL LIBERTY OF USING IT, IF NOT I WILL REPLACE FOR FURTHER RELEASE AND TRY TO FIND SOMETHING WITH THE SAME MYSTICAL URGENCY. BECAUSE DOESN’T EVERY GUY WANNA BE REMEMBERED AS A HEROIC WIZARD STANDING ON A CLIFF HOLDING A TORCH? . ",

FASHION HAS ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT COMMUNICATION, AND SIGNALING VALUE SYSTEMS TO OTHERS. VALUE SYSTEMS REGARDING PHYSICAL BEAUTY AND STATUS BUT ALSO ABOUT MORAL BEAUTY AND BEAUTIFUL BEHAVIOR. IN TIMES OF MENACE AND STRIFE, THE WAY WE PRESENT OURSELVES CAN EXPRESS WHAT WE ENDORSE AND ASPIRE TO— AN EMPATHETIC AND GRACIOUS WAY OF MOVING THROUGH THE WORLD AND TREATING OTHERS. I BELIEVE AESOP HAS ALWAYS EXPRESSED THESE VALUES THROUGH AESTHETIC, HYGIENIC, AND MORAL BEAUTY. IT IS A BRAND THAT CONSIDERS ITS SPACE IN THE WORLD AND USES THAT SPACE AS CONSIDERATELY AS POSSIBLE. WE HAVE COLLABORATED ON A FRAGRANCE THAT IS DIFFUSED THROUGH THE PORTABLE FOG MACHINES THE MODELS CARRY LIKE BRUTALIST THURIBLES. OILS AND CANDLES WITH THIS FRAGRANCE WILL BE RELEASED LATER THIS MONTH. GENTLE MANTLES, TUNICS, AND COWLS COME IN MUTED TONES OF ALPACA FELT RECALLING THE FELTS ALWAYS USED BY JOSEPH BEUYS, WHOM I HAVE REFERENCED AD NAUSEAM, AND DRAGGING ROBES ARE DRAPED IN GOBS AND FISTFULS OF DUST COLORED SEQUINS. DUVET JACKETS IN RECYCLED NYLON, PYTHON, OR PIRARUCU ARE KNOTTED AROUND THE UPPER TORSO OVER LANGUID BIAS GOWNS IN VELVET OR WASHED DENIM OR KNIT RECYCLED CASHMERE. CANDY COLORED CONFECTIONS IN COLLAGED SHEARLINGS ARE CUT AS CROPPED, VOLUMINOUS BLOUSONS OR FLAT, LONG AND WIDE SOFT SHIELDS. THESE SHEARLING COLORS REINTERPRET SPRING’S PLATFORM SPARTAN WADER BOOTS AS WELL. HIGH AND SHARP SHOULDERS ON T-SHIRTS, SWEATERS, AND JKTS ELONGATE THE ARM AND FRAME THE FACE WITH AN ALIEN SLOUCH. THEDA BARA PARKAS WITH EXTRAVAGANT GOAT FUR TRIM COME IN BLACK LEATHER, ORANGE CANVAS OR REFLEX— AN INDUSTRIALLY FAMILIAR RETROFLECTIVE FABRIC WOVEN FROM YARN MADE FROM GLASS. 100% OF OUR COTTON JERSEYS ARE ORGANIC GOTS CERTIFIED COTTON. 90% OF OUR COTTON WOVENS ARE ORGANIC CERTIFIED COTTON. OUR SHEARLING COLLAGES ARE BY-PRODUCTS OF THE FOOD INDUSTRY AND ARE FROM LWG CERTIFIED FAMILY-OWNED TANNERIES IN ITALY. OUR LEATHERS AND SNAKE SKINS ARE PART OF A TRACEABILITY PROGRAM THAT CONTINUES TO REGULARLY AUDIT EACH STEP OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN IN ORDER TO GUARANTEE IT IS SECURE AND ETHICAL. PIRARUCU IS SOURCED DIRECTLY FROM A LOCAL SUPPLIER IN BRAZIL WITH A TANNERY THAT COLLABORATES WITH THE LOCAL POPULATION THAT USES THE FISH FOR FOOD AND THEN THE SKINS PROVIDE THEM WITH AN EXTRA INCOME. I DON’T MENTION ALL THIS OUT OF VIRTUOUSNESS, WE DEFINITELY HAVE ROOM TO IMPROVE. I JUST LIKE PROMOTING THE CONVERSATION FASHION IS HAVING ABOUT RESPONSIBILITY. UPON RECENT LISTENING, THE EXCLUSIVE REMIX FROM EPROM I HAD PLANNED 3 MONTHS AGO FELT TOO HARSH AND OMINOUS FOR THE CURRENT MOMENT SO AT THE LAST MINUTE I SUBSTITUTED IT WITH MAHLER’S 5TH SYMPHONY, A PIECE I WOULD HAVE CONSIDERED TOO SENTIMENTAL IN THE PAST, BUT BETTER SUITED FOR THE SOBRIETY AND SEARCH FOR HOPE IN OUR CURRENT CONDITION. I HAVE ALWAYS FOUND GREAT COMFORT THAT IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD GOOD HAS SOMEHOW ALWAYS MANAGED TO TRIUMPH OVER EVIL. DURING TIMES OF HEARTBREAK, BEAUTY CAN BE ONE OF THE WAYS TO MAINTAIN FAITH.

NIJINSKY HAD TO HAVE HAD THE SHOCK OF CUBISM IN MIND WHEN HE DEPARTED FROM TRADITIONAL BALLET BY STRIPPING THE MOVEMENTS DOWN TO SOMETHING CONSIDERED CRUDE AND AWKWARD AT THE TIME, AND TAKING THE SOFT ROMANCE OF BALLET TO A MORE CARNAL PLACE. THIS RICK OWENS SPRING SUMMER WOMEN’S COLLECTION REFLECTS ON THIS BALANCE BETWEEN HARD NEWNESS AND CLASSICAL GRACE, AND THE ETERNAL CYCLE OF CONFRONTATION WHEN A NEW GENERATION CHALLENGES THE OLD BY TEARING THINGS DOWN AND ROUGHLY STARTS HACKING AWAY AT SOMETHING NEW IN OUR URGE TO MOVE FORWARD IN A MORE LOGICAL WAY. SILHOUETTES ARE RATIONALIST SUMMER ESSENTIALS– ROOMY SHORTS, TUBE TOPS, THE SIMPLEST OF JUMBO SLEEVELESS T’S AND SIMPLE BLOCKY MANTLES. BUT ALMOST EVERYTHING IS IN TRADITIONAL TULLE, EACH GARMENT’S COMPOSED OF LAYERS OF MUTED LÉON BAKST COLORS CUT INTO SEVERE ARCHITECTURAL SHAPES.

BAGGY SHORTS CUT IN HAND WAXED POPLIN OR CRISP NYLON ARE SLICED, FLOUNCED AND FRILLED– TO BE WORN WITH SAW-TOOTHED WOODEN CLOGS BOUND TO THE ANKLES WITH CRISP RIBBONS.

A MILITARY SILHOUETTE IS A CLASSIC REFERENCE FOR MEN’S CLOTHES. THE EFFECT OF MILITARY UNIFORMS HAS BEEN ANALYZED AND DEVELOPED OVER GENERATIONS TO SUMMARIZE WHAT A MAN WANTS TO LOOK LIKE EFFICIENT, WELL PROPORTIONED, RATIONAL, DIGNIFIED AND HEROIC. BUT THE PARTICULAR U.S. M1965 FIELD JACKET COLLAR AND PLACKET THAT I HAVE BASED THIS COLLECTION ON SUGGESTS A HOST OF OTHER REFERENCES, NOTABLY REBELLION, COUNTERCULTURE AND ANTI-WAR PROTEST A COLLAR FROM THE PAST THAT SUGGESTS HEROISM AND QUESTIONS IT AT THE SAME TIME. I’VE FETISHIZED THIS JACKET METALLIZING IT, DISTORTING IT, SHREDDING IT, FLARING IT, PAINTING IT BLACK… WORN OVER SHORTS AND SANDALS, IT’S MY VERSION OF AN ETERNAL HIPPIE SPIRIT LOOKING FOR INNER PURITY, OPPOSING CONFLICT, AND CONTRIBUTING TO THE PERPETUATION OF COSMIC LOVE. AND ALL OF THIS BEST EXPRESSED IN BLACK LEATHER. LEATHER IS ALSO TRANSPARENT HERE IN A PROCESS THAT PRESERVES THE LEATHER BUT STOPS SHORT OF DYEING IT. IT’S THEN WAXED IN A PROCEDURE SIMILAR TO DRUM SKINS. THIS PROCESS IS ALSO APPLIED TO SNAKESKIN AND USED IN T-SHIRTS AND THE SIMPLEST OF SLIM ZIPPERED WINDBREAKERS. AND FINALLY, I PROPOSE A SERIES OF TURBO-DRAPED AND COLLAGED TOPS IN ROUGH TOILE AND PAINTED CANVAS MAKING IT PRETTY OBVIOUS THAT I’VE BEEN A FAN OF JOHN CHAMBERLAIN’S SCULPTURES AND STEVEN PARRINO’S PAINTINGS ALL MY LIFE ARTISTIC HEROES WHO EMERGED AND EXPERIMENTED IN THE WAKE OF THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION OF THE AMERICAN 1960S. THIS RICK OWENS SPRING SUMMER 2016 MEN’S COLLECTION IS TITLED CYCLOPS A MONSTER WITH A NARROW FOCAL POINT. I CAN SEE THIS IN MYSELF IN MY DETERMINED URGE TO FIND THE STRAIGHTEST LINE FROM POINT A TO POINT B AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. A TRAIT I HAVE ALWAYS ASSUMED IS MOSTLY A MASCULINE ONE.

NOTES . THIS RICK OWENS SPRING SUMMER 2016 WOMEN’S COLLECTION IS ENTITLED CYCLOPS, A MYTHOLOGICAL CREATURE, FORMIDABLE, WITH FOCUSED VISION. WHO AMONG US WOULDN’T APPRECIATE THAT KIND OF DESCRIPTION? IN THE SPRING MEN’S COLLECTION, WHICH SHARES THE SAME NAME, THAT FOCUSED VISION WAS PROPULSIVE AND AGGRESSIVE. WHEN APPLIED TO WOMEN, I SEE THAT FOCUSED VISION BEING MORE ABOUT NOURISHMENT, SISTERHOOD/MOTHERHOOD AND REGENERATION; WOMEN RAISING WOMEN, WOMEN BECOMING WOMEN AND WOMEN SUPPORTING WOMEN A WORLD OF WOMEN I KNOW LITTLE ABOUT AND CAN ONLY ATTEMPT TO AMUSE IN MY OWN SMALL WAY. STRAPS CAN BE ABOUT RESTRAINT BUT HERE THEY ARE ALL ABOUT SUPPORT AND CRADLING. STRAPS HERE BECOME LOVING RIBBONS. STURDY SANDALS PROVIDE A STEADY BASE FOR LIGHT-AS-AIR SHIFTS. TUNICS AND BOXERS ARE TOPPED WITH CRISPLY CUTAWAY COATS WITH NARROW, SHARPLY DEFINED SHOULDERS. SLEEVES ON THE COATS ARE RIPPED OFF OR CAN BE REMOVED TO DRIFT BEHIND THE BARE ARM LIKE A CAPE. AFTER A LONG PERIOD OF ADDRESSING THE PURSUIT OF THE ILLUSION OF CONTROL WITH GEOMETRIC MOTIFS AND CUTS THAT BELONG IN A CONCRETE BRUTALIST UTOPIA, THIS COLLECTION UNABASHEDLY COLLAPSES INTO WALLOWING SENSUALITY WITH SWIRLING AND DRIPPING GLOBS OF WASHED SILK GAZAR AND CLOQUE THAT POINT MORE IN THE DIRECTION OF AN ART NOUVEAU LANDSCAPE. FISTFULS OF SILK ORGANZA AND RAW CANVAS ARE TWISTED AND ABSTRACTEDLY DRAPED INTO SOMETHING AS CLOSE TO FLORAL AS I’LL PROBABLY EVER GET. ALL THIS ORGANIC LIMPNESS IS COUNTERED WITH THE CLASSIC RIGOR OF SIMPLE FLIGHT JACKETS, HOODED WINDBREAKERS AND SLEEVELESS BIKERS ALL IN VARYING WEIGHTS OF BLACK LEATHER AND A METALLIC FABRIC THAT I CHOSE FOR ITS SEMBLANCE TO SOMETHING JOHN CHAMBERLAIN WOULD HAVE MADE ONE OF HIS CRUMPLED STEEL SCULPTURES OUT OF. LEATHER IS ALSO TRANSPARENT, USING A PROCESS THAT PRESERVES THE LEATHER BUT STOPS SHORT OF DYEING IT. IT’S THEN WAXED IN A PROCEDURE SIMILAR TO DRUM SKINS. THIS PROCESS IS ALSO APPLIED TO SNAKESKIN TO CREATE A WEIRD ORGANZA/HIDE EFFECT. THE MUSIC FOR THE SHOW IS UNKLE’S ARRANGEMENT OF ‘THIS LAND’, THE THEME FROM THE MOVIE ‘EXODUS1’, A SONG I USE HERE AS A REFLECTION ON THE TIMELESSLY FEMALE WAY OF PROTECTING AND NURTURING A TRIBE, SUNG LIVE BY VOCAL POWERHOUSE ESKA.

NOTES . THIS MEN’S SPRING COLLECTION IS TITLED ‘WALRUS’, AN EVOLUTION OF FALL’S COLLECTION NAME, ‘MASTODON’— EVOLUTION BEING THE KEY WORD HERE. FASHION IS ALL ABOUT REFLECTING CHANGE AND CHANGES ARE HAPPENING. WE CAN FEAR CHANGE AND CLING TO THE SENTIMENTALLY FAMILIAR OR CHEERFULLY FLING OURSELVES INTO THE UNKNOWN. REMEMBER HOW THAT USED TO FEEL? I SUPPOSE I PROPOSE A LITTLE OF BOTH. I LIKE THINKING NEITHER IS WRONG. JACKET LENGTHS ARE CROPPED WITH LENGTHENED SLEEVES TO CHANGE THE POSTURE AND LIFT THE TORSO UPWARDS WHILE PANTS SWIRL WITH VOLUME AND CASCADE, MELTING INTO THE GROUND. THESE CLOTHES ARE REACHING AND STRETCHING AND SWELLING AND FLOATING AND SWEEPING. FABRICS ARE CRISP LIKE THE THINNEST SILK TAFFETAS AND WASHED SILK GAZARS, OR STURDY LIKE THICK INDUSTRIAL COTTONS. A SILK AND COTTON DUCHESSE BRIDGES THE GAP BETWEEN THE TWO AND CREATES AN ARCHITECTURALLY STATELY, MATTE SILHOUETTE. T-SHIRTS ARE TWISTED AND MEGA-DRAPED AS IRRATIONALLY AS POSSIBLE, CREATING STRIATED VOLUMES SIMILAR TO MUSCLES AND TENDONS IN A MEDICAL DIAGRAM— IF A MEDICAL DIAGRAM WERE SKETCHED BY MADAME GRÈS, ONE OF MY PERSONAL, REASSURINGLY SENTIMENTAL, FAVORITES. THESE DRAPES SHOW UP AGAIN ON THE EASIEST OF COTTON DOESKIN ZIP FRONT WORK JACKETS. WITHOUT THE DRAPING, THESE JACKETS OFFER A SIMPLE, MODEST DIGNITY, ESPECIALLY WHEN INTERPRETED IN RIGID GLEAMING SILK. BLACK LEATHER JACKETS ARE AS HIGH AND TIGHT AS POSSIBLE TO MOLD TO THE RIB CAGE AND THEN RELEASE THE VOLUME OF THE JUMBO BODYBAGS WORN UNDERNEATH, TO END DRAGGING ON THE FLOOR. SOME PIECES ARE EMBROIDERED WITH LINES THAT RADIATE OUT FROM THE GUT— A LINEAR INTERPRETATION OF THIS COLLECTION’S SILHOUETTE AND A SIMPLE MOTIF HISTORICALLY USED TO SYMBOLIZE HOLISTIC BENEVOLENCE, AS IN CHRIST’S SACRED HEART OR A SMILING SUN CARTOON. THESE LINES ARE THEN REPEATED IN BRONZE TURBO-BUGLE BEADING. MY COLLABORATION WITH ADIDAS RESULTS IN OUR NEW ‘LEVEL RUNNER’, OUR SLEEKEST VERSION OF A PERFORMANCE RUNNING SHOE YET. AND THE SIMPLE, MODEST DIGNITY OF NEIL YOUNG SOUNDTRACKS THIS COLLECTION WITH HIS GENTLE 1970 ECOLOGICAL DOOM POEM ‘AFTER THE GOLD RUSH’. I LIKE TO INTERPRET THIS SONG AS DEALING WITH INEVITABLE TRANSITIONS GRACEFULLY. ",

    "content": "NOTES . AS ALWAYS, THE WOMEN’S COLLECTION SHARES THE SAME NAME AS ITS MEN’S COUNTERPART— AND THIS SPRING’S NAME IS ‘WALRUS’. THE IDEA OF USING THE NAME OF AN ALIEN-LOOKING CREATURE SO FAR REMOVED FROM OUR EVERYDAY WORLD HELPS ME THINK OF MAKING CLOTHES IN THE CONTEXT OF AN ETERNITY OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL CYCLES AND FRAGILE ECOLOGICAL BALANCES. I AM REMINDED OF, AND SOMEWHAT COMFORTED BY, OUR MINUSCULE PRESENCE IN THAT TRAJECTORY. FRAGILITY IS WHAT I WAS GOING FOR THIS SEASON. BLOBS OF LINEN TULLE AND THREADWORN T-SHIRT JERSEY ARE HAPHAZARDLY DRAPED AND SWAGGED, TWISTED AND WRAPPED AROUND THE BODY, GENTLY AND SOFTLY DISTORTING IT. CROPPED JACKETS CONSTRUCTED OF TULLE AND BUCKRUM SCAFFOLDING ARE A BLUNT AMERICAN’S CRUDE INTERPRETATION OF DELICATE ART NOUVEAU PARISIAN CONFECTION. BREEZY WINDBREAKERS ARE CUT IN GERMAN HORSHAIR ORIGINALLY PRODUCED IN THE 18TH CENTURY TO REPLACE SILK AND LATER USED FOR CRINOLINES. THE WEFT OF THE FABRIC IS WOVEN FROM THE STRANDS OF A HORSE’S TAIL AND RESULTS IN A VOLUME THAT HAS THE BRITTLE TEXTURE OF SPUN SUGAR. ‘FOG COATS’ ARE PRODUCED BY MAISON LEMARIÉ, THE LEGENDARY PARISIAN PLUMASSIER, FROM INDIVIDUAL OSTRICH STRANDS THAT HAVE BEEN HAND-KNOTTED END-TO-END AND THEN MOUNTED BY THE THOUSANDS ON SILK GAZAR COATS. THIS IS A TECHNIQUE INVENTED FOR THE FIRST REVILLON COLLECTION I DID YEARS AGO AND, FROM WHAT LEMARIÉ TELLS ME, NEVER DONE BY ANYONE ELSE. EXTRA LONG GLASS BUGLE BEADS CUSTOM MADE IN MURANO SKETCH OUT A RADIATING MOTIF ON THICK COTTON MANTLES THAT HAVE A SLIT IN THE BACK TO ALLOW THEM TO BE WORN ARMS-FREE AS AN ABSTRACT PONCHO. THESE PONCHO/MANTLES ARE HAND-TINTED WITH DEGRADE FIELDS OF YELLOW, MAUVE, BLACK, AND LIGHT GRAY— THE PREVAILING COLORS OF THE COLLECTION. SOME HAVE SABLE FUR WHIRLPOOL APPLIQUES. SHORTS HAVE EXTENDED PANELS IN FRONT AND BACK TO PROVIDE A HINT OF EXTRAVAGANT ABANDON. BOOTS AND SHOES HAVE A NARROW AND EXTENDED SQUARED-OFF TOE, LIKE A SQUASHED TAIL PIPE, WITH SOME STYLES BANDED WITH OUR MURANO TURBO BUGLE BEADS. GROWING UP IN 1970S SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, HALTER TOPS, CUTOFFS, AND HIKING BOOTS SEEMED THE MOST FREE-SPIRITED AND LOGICAL OUTFIT FOR THE MOUNTAIN GIRLS I KNEW, WHICH ALWAYS STUCK WITH ME AS THE MOST MODEST AND PRACTICAL APPROACH TO DRESSING IN WARM WEATHER. BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THIS COLLECTION IS AN ELABORATION OF THAT FORMULA. NINA SIMONE PROVIDES THE SOUNDTRACK WITH HER MODERNIST INTERPRETATION OF THE CLASSICAL FOLK SONG ‘BLACK IS THE COLOR OF MY TRUE LOVE’S HAIR’, AND ‘WILD IS THE WIND’— SONGS OF FRAGILE TENDERNESS… I LISTEN TO NINA EVERY DAY… .

NOTES . I’VE NAMED THIS SPRING/SUMMER MEN’S COLLECTION ‘DIRT’ AS A COUNTERPOINT TO LAST SEASON’S ‘GLITTER’ AND TO EVOKE A REDUCTIVE, ETERNAL AND BLUNT ANSWER TO OUR TEMPORARY CHAOTIC HUMAN CONDITION. MY RECENT ABSORPTION IN LAND ART — ARCHITECTURE UNLEASHED — IS ABOUT THE HUMAN NEED TO TRY TO FIND ORDER IN WILDERNESS… MAYBE AS A FUTILE ATTEMPT TO PUT A MARK ON IT AS A STAB AT IMMORTALITY, OR SIMPLY AS A CHANCE TO CREATE A BEAUTIFUL, PHYSICAL MAN/PLANET UNION. …AND I ALWAYS THINK OF THE EXPRESSION OF BEAUTY AS THE OPPOSITE OF DEATH. IT COMFORTS ME TO THINK IN BROAD, CRUDE STROKES LIKE THIS… . I’VE FOCUSED ON THE SUIT JACKET AS RESPECTFUL UNIFORM, AS A SYMBOL OF CIVILIZATION, AS ELEGANT LUGGAGE, AS PERSONAL ASPIRATIONAL ARCHITECTURE. JACKETS HERE ARE IN A DRY NYLON COTTON THAT HAS THE DULL SHEEN OF SILK DUCHESSE AND THE RUGGEDNESS OF A BACKPACK. SOME BLAZERS ARE CUT LARGE AND ROOMY WITH POCKETS BIG ENOUGH FOR A SANDWICH (ONE OF MY PERSONAL CRITERIA), AND OTHERS ARE CUT TIGHT AND HIGH TO LIFT THE TORSO AND ANY SPIRITUAL ZONE UP AND AT THE READY. TOPS ARE LIKE HAPHAZARDLY DRAPED PLASTIC TARPS WRAPPED AROUND HALF-FINISHED CONSTRUCTIONS… SLICK, SHINY, AND REFLECTIVE BUT CHEAP AND RAW. PANTS ARE HIGH-WAISTED AND FULL IN THE LEG TO DRAG LUXURIOUSLY ON THE GROUND LIKE A BALL GOWN OR HIKED UP TO REVEAL DIRT HIKING BOOTS WITH TRACTOR-TURBO TREAD. CUSTOM DEVELOPED FABRICS INCLUDE: LACQUERED 12OZ DENIM IN INDUSTRIAL BLACK, BLUE, AND GREEN. SUGAR TWILL GERMAN PAPER YARN WOVEN WITH A POLYAMIDE YARN ON A JACQUARD LOOM TO CREATE A DEEPLY TEXTURED, BRITTLE GAZAR TWILL. MATTE CANVAS HIGH TWIST ELASTANE YARN WOVEN ON A NARROW ARTISANAL LOOM WITH MINIMAL FINISHING FOR A DRY, CHALKY HAND. PLASTIC TARP LUREX TAPE WOVEN ON A METAL WARP AND USED IN ITS OFF-LOOM UNFINISHED AND UNSTRETCHED STATE TO CREATE A STIFF, BURNT PLASTIC TEXTURE. SHEER WOOL GAZAR MADE FROM WOOL AND RAW SILK FILAMENT YARN, WASHED AND SUN DRIED. THE PALAIS DE TOKYO, MY FAVORITE BUILDING IN PARIS, FEELS LIKE AN ART DECO WAGNERIAN VALHALLA… I LOVE THE GRAND SYMMETRY OF THE PARVIS WITH THE WINGS OF THE BUILDING STRETCHING AROUND TO EMBRACE THE POOL… I HAVE INSTALLED CONSTRUCTIVIST SCAFFOLDING TO SERVE AS A MONUMENTAL WALKWAY TO TOUR THE FULL HEIGHT AND WIDTH OF IT… IT’S KIND OF A WAY OF CARESSING ITS INNER WALLS AND LICKING EVERY INCH OF A BUILDING THAT’S ONLY PURPOSE IS AS A TEMPLE TO BEAUTY. I WAS THINKING OF VLADIMIR TATLIN’S TOWER SET TO LED ZEPPELIN’S ‘STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN’…. BUT THE SOUNDTRACK I KNEW I REALLY WANTED TO USE WAS EGYPTIAN LOVER’S ‘I NEED A FREAK’, ONE OF MY FAVORITE ANTHEMS FROM 1984 LA…. KURTIS BLOW MEETS KRAFTWERK MEETS CAMP. ‘I NEED A FREAK’ — MY TRANSLATION; IN THESE TIMES OF PETTY DISCORD AND ANXIETY I’M LOOKING FOR TRANSGRESSIVE INSPIRATION AND IMAGINATION… . ",

NOTES . STOICISM FERTILITY FUTURISM HOPE . INSTEAD OF MORBIDLY ROMANTICIZING OUR SOCIO-ECOLOGICAL PERIL, WHICH I HAVE SO GLEEFULLY INDULGED IN IN THE PAST, I FEEL I NEED TO PROPOSE EXPERIMENTAL GRACE AND FORM AS A GESTURE OF TURNING AWAY FROM THREAT; NOT REALLY AS ESCAPISM, BUT AS REJECTION. TWISTED CURVED AND FLANGED FORMS CIRCLING AROUND THE BODY ARE CONSTRUCTED IN SEVERAL EXCLUSIVELY DEVELOPED FABRICS: . TWILL GAZAR MADE FROM A SILK AND PAPER YARN A NYLON/COTTON TECHNICAL CANVAS WITH THE SHEEN OF A DUCHESSE STIFF COTTON SATEEN CANVAS A CHALKY MATTE RUBBER AND COTTON CANVAS SHINY LACQUERED CANVAS METAL MEGA-BUGLE BEADED CANVAS . CANVAS AS A MODEST MATERIAL TO SCULPT AND PAINT ON HAS ALWAYS APPEALED TO ME SINCE ART SCHOOL; CANVAS JUST FEELS LIKE POTENTIAL AND A FRESH START. AS FAR AS SOME PIECES VEER TOWARDS ABSTRACTION, THEY ALL HAVE INTERIOR ZIPPED COMPARTMENTS WHICH OSTENSIBLY TURN THEM INTO GLORIFIED HANDBAGS. CARGO LEG CHAPS AND FERTILITY BELTS ALSO CREATE SWELLING VOLUMES TO SCRAMBLE FAMILIAR BODY SHAPE. THIN WHITE COTTON T-SHIRTS ARE STRETCHED OVER THE BODY IN LAYERS OF NECKHOLES AND ARMHOLES TO CREATE A CRUDE AMERICAN’S BRUTALIST INTERPRETATION OF FRENCH CONFECTION. THE 1908 ITALIAN FUTURIST HEAD BY THAYAHT ON THE INVITATION PORTRAYS THE POET FILIPPO TOMMASO MARINETTI, THE AUTHOR OF THE FUTURIST MANIFESTO. THERE ARE A FEW UNFORTUNATE ATTITUDES IN THIS MANIFESTO REGARDING WOMEN AND BOOK BURNING BUT THAT’S WHAT’S FASCINATING ABOUT RADICAL UTOPIAN MOVEMENTS — THEY START WITH THE BEST INTENTIONS BUT THEN DEGENERATE AND CRUMBLE UNTIL THE NEXT WAVE OF HOPE APPEARS OVER THE HORIZON. THE SOUNDTRACK IS A BARE BONES REMIX OF A SONG BY LAVASCAR — A NEW BAND FORMED BY HUN, HER DAUGHTER SCARLETT, AND NICO VASCELLARI. ",

NOTES . NAMED AFTER MY GRANDMOTHER’S MIXTEC MAIDEN NAME. I’VE BEEN MOTIVATED TO EXPLORE MY PERSONAL MEXICANNESS AS A REACTION TO THE U.S. PRESIDENT’S FIXATION ON A BORDER WALL. COLLAB WITH UNITED FARM WORKERS ASSOCIATION… I WAS RAISED IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BY AN ANGLO FATHER AND NATIVE MEXICAN MOTHER. MY MOTHER AND I LEARNED ENGLISH TOGETHER WHEN SHE STARTED TAKING ME TO NURSERY SCHOOL. MY FATHER WORKED IN THE PORTERVILLE PUBLIC COURT SYSTEM AS A TRANSLATOR FOR THE MEXICAN MIGRANT FARM WORKERS THAT WERE A MAJOR PART OF THE SAN JOAQUIN AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY. AWARENESS OF THE AZTEC EAGLE ON THE UNITED FARM WORKERS FLAG AND THE STRUGGLES IT REPRESENTED WAS A PART OF MY GROWING UP. THE UNITED FARM WORKERS ASSOCIATION HAS KINDLY ALLOWED ME TO USE THEIR LOGO FOR THIS COLLECTION, WITH PROCEEDS FROM OUR COLLABORATION BENEFITING THEIR CONTINUING EFFORTS. FLAG GRAPHICS ARE USED ON T-SHIRTS AND OVERSHIRTS THAT WILL BE SOLD VIA OUR E-COMMERCE SITE. COLLAB WITH THOMAS HOUSEAGO… WHEN I REALIZED MY RUNWAY SHOW WOULD LITERALLY BE REVOLVING AROUND HIS SCULPTURE INSTALLED IN THE PALAIS DE TOKYO FOUNTAIN, I ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD LIKE TO EXTEND HIS INFLUENCE FURTHER INTO THE COLLECTION. INTERESTINGLY, HE HAD BEEN THINKING OF BORDER WALLS AND AZTEC HIEROGLYPHICS AS WELL AND ALLOWED ME TO USE ONE OF HIS WALL SCULPTURES AS OUR INVITE ART. I ASKED TO HAVE SOME OF HIS L.A. STUDIO CLAY SHIPPED TO PARIS TO USE ON THE RUNWAY, REFERENCING HIS PERFORMANCE VIDEO IN HIS MUSÉE D’ART MODERNE SHOW… AFTER MY RUNWAY SHOW, THE CLAY WILL GO TO L’ÉCOLE DES BEAUX-ARTS TO BE USED BY STUDENTS IN THE SCULPTING DEPARTMENT. A SELECTION OF HOUSEAGO LABELED GARMENTS AND RUNNERS ARE MEGALACED WITH A BLACK WAX OR A WHITE WAX FINISH, ECHOING THE TEXTURES OF HIS WORK COLLAB WITH VEJA — THE MOST ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY SNEAKER BRAND I COULD FIND (TO QUOTE MYSELF, “I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO AUTHORITY TO PROMOTE SUSTAINABILITY, BUT I DO ENDORSE THE IDEA OF THOUGHTFUL LIVING AND PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE WITH KINDNESS IN MIND. WE ALL GOTTA START SOMEWHERE”.) OUR COLLAB CONTINUES WITH A NEW HIKING SNEAKER IN GREYSCALE AND ASYMMETRICAL DETAILS. COLLAB WITH CHAMPION — I REMEMBER MY COUSINS WEARING CHAMPION TEES AND SHORTS WHEN WE USED TO GO VISIT THE FAMILY IN MEXICO IN THE SEVENTIES… HERE I HAVE TURNED THOSE SPORTS CLOTHES INTO TOGAS, LOINCLOTHS AND BRIEFS…..CHAMPION KINDLY ACCEPTED DOING THEIR LOGO IN BLACK, WHITE, AND GREY AND WE HAVE SPRINKLED IT LIBERALLY OVER A CAPSULE INCLUDING T-SHIRTS, SWEATS, AND WINDBREAKERS. I CONTINUE WITH A SHARP-SHOULDERED TAILORED SILHOUETTE, AT TIMES COVERED IN BRIGHT SEQUINS LIKE THE FOLKLORIC CHINA POBLANA SKIRTS MY MOM WORE IN SCHOOL PAGEANTS GROWING UP IN PUEBLA, MEXICO. BLAZERS HAVE INTEGRATED STRAPS TO PEEL JACKETS OFF AND WEAR BUCKLED AROUND THE HIPS ON THE DANCE FLOOR. BLAZERS AND LIGHT COATS ARE WORN OVER ZIPPERED JUMPSUITS OR FULL HIGH WAISTED ZIPPERED CARGO SHORTS. FABRICS ARE IRISÉ COATED CANVAS, MEMBRANE RUBBERIZED NYLONS, PAPER-THIN SNAKE, COTTON DUCHESSE, AND NYLON TAFFETA. FOOTWEAR INCLUDES GLAM PLATFORM BOOTS IN CLEAR PLEXI, AFOREMENTIONED MEGALACED SNEAKERS, OR EARTHY SANDALS IN COW FUR. MUSIC IS AN EXTENDED REMIX OF ‘ACCELERATION’ BY LAVASCAR, MY BEAUTIFUL WIFE MICHELE LAMY’S BAND WITH NICO VASCELLARI AND DAUGHTER SCARLETT ROUGE (LAMY/VASCELLARI/SCARLETT), PRODUCED BY ROCCO RAMPINO. I INVITED MUSICIANS FROM MEXICO TO ACCOMPANY LAVASCAR’S TRACK WITH DANZA AZTECA CEREMONIAL MUSIC THAT THEY HAVE LEARNED FROM THEIR ELDERS. VOCALS ARE IN THE TRADITIONAL NAHUATL AZTEC LANGUAGE “TECUATL NONAN, AMIXPANZINCO ONCAN NOYOLO. CUICATL ANYOLQUEH XOCHITL ANCUEPONQUE” “LORDESS OF WATER, HERE IN FRONT OF YOUR HONORABLE GAZE, IS MY HEART. YOU KNOW THIS LIFE SONG YOU HAVE LAID OUT YOURSELF LIKE FLOWERS…” . ",

NOTES . NAMED AFTER MY GRANDMOTHER’S MIXTEC MAIDEN NAME. I NEVER REALLY EXPLORED MY MEXICAN-NESS BUT THE DEBATE OVER A BORDER WALL MADE ME MORE CONSCIOUS OF WHO I WOULD BE SEPARATED FROM. WHEN I WAS A KID, MY DAD WOULD DRAG MY MOM AND ME TO A RUN-DOWN MEXICAN MOVIE THEATRE IN OUR SMALL TOWN THAT CATERED TO THE MIGRANT FARM WORKERS WHO POPULATED OUR AREA… HE WAS WHITE AND MOM WAS MEXICAN AND HE WORKED IN THE PORTERVILLE PUBLIC COURT SYSTEM AS A SPANISH TO ENGLISH TRANSLATOR DEFENDING THE WORKERS RIGHTS. MARÍA FÉLIX WAS THE DIETRICH OF MEXICAN CINEMA AND USUALLY PLAYED A STRONG AND DEFIANT WOMAN IN A MALE DOMINATED SOCIETY. IRL, SHE LATER MOVED TO PARIS AND AMASSED A LEGENDARY CARTIER JEWELRY COLLECTION. I ASKED TECHNO WIZARD GAGE TO DO A CUSTOM RUNWAY MIX USING HER VOCALS FROM A SONG FROM ONE OF THOSE MOVIES, REPEATING THE PHRASE “CORAZON, TU DIRAS LO QUE HACEMOS” … MY HEART, YOU DECIDE WHAT WE DO… . AFTER LEAVING THE BAUHAUS AND GERMANY IN THE 1930S, JOSEF AND ANNI ALBERS EXPLORED ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES IN MEXICO. THEIR REDUCTIVE MODERNISM APPLIED TO PYRAMIDS AND HIEROGLYPHICS IS A PRECEDENT TO THE LINEAR MOTIFS USED HERE IN SHOULDER STRAPS ON DRESSES AND MEGA-LACING ON DUCHESSE BOMBERS… KNIT DRESSES ALSO TRACE THE BODY IN GEOMETRIC PLANES AND LINES, SLASHED TO REVEAL THE BODY BRAZENLY OR VEILED WITH THE THINNEST COTTON T-SHIRTS. LUIS BARRAGÁN’S SATURATED BLASTS OF STRONG HUES INFORM THE COLOR STORY — PINK, YELLOW, WHITE, BLACK, RED — CRISP, UNCOMPLICATED, STRAIGHTFORWARD, AND UNASHAMEDLY EARNEST. I ASKED MASK ARTISANS WINTERCROFT TO SCULPT METALLIC ALIEN AZTEC CROWNS THAT MIGHT HAVE COME FROM A FRITZ LANG MOVIE. THEY ARE WORN WITH OUR NEW SUNGLASS SHAPE THAT REMINDS ME OF THE EAST L.A. LOWRIDERS I REMEMBER FROM MY YOUTH THERE. DOES THAT CULTURE STILL FLOURISH? I DON’T KNOW, HAVEN’T BEEN BACK TO L.A. IN 18 YEARS… . I CONTINUE WITH A SHARP-SHOULDERED SILHOUETTE, AT TIMES COVERED IN BRIGHT SEQUINS LIKE THE FOLKLORIC CHINA POBLANA SKIRTS MY MOM WORE IN CHURCH PAGEANTS GROWING UP IN PUEBLA, MEXICO. BLAZERS AND OVERSHIRTS HAVE INTEGRATED STRAPS TO PEEL THEM OFF AND WEAR BUCKLED AROUND THE HIPS ON THE DANCE FLOOR. THERE IS ALSO FOLKLORIC VOLUME IN MANTLES AND COATS THAT ARE SIMPLE AND OVERSIZED IN SMOOTH, TURBO-STUDDED SILK OR DELIRIOUSLY MEGA-PLEATED IN STURDY, COLORFUL MATTE COTTONS. FABRICS INCLUDE MY FAVORITE COTTON CANVASES, THIS TIME COATED IN A BEETLE WING IRIDESCENCE, COTTON DUCHESSE, SILK CREPES, AND GLITTERY GLOW-MESH (!). THE BROKEN STRIPE I OFTEN REPEAT IS HERE RENDERED AS THE TRADITIONAL MEXICAN REBOZO. PLATFORM BOOTS HAVE BEEN STRETCHED INTO A FUTURISTIC COWBOY BOOT SHAPE WITH A CLEAR HEEL. AND THE UBIQUITOUS BUM BAG HAS BEEN TWISTED INTO A SCULPTURAL FLOURISH JUTTING OUT AT THE PELVIS.

MY LAST FALL RUNWAY SHOULDER FREAK OUT WASN’T ABOUT POWER, IT WAS ABOUT DEFIANCE — DEFIANCE IN THE FACE OF THREAT.

THE WORD ‘QUARANTINE’ ORIGINATED FROM THIS AREA’S MEDIEVAL RESPONSE TO THE BUBONIC PLAGUE.

BLACK GRAIN DE POUDRE TAILORING IS OVERSIZED WITH SLEEVES RIPPED OFF OF HULKING SHOULDERS… STRAPS ALLOW THE WEARER TO STRIP JKTS OFF AND CINCH AROUND WAISTS AS A BEACH BUSTLE… AND SATIN RIB WAISTED BOMBERS HAVE SHOULDERS THAT ARE AN EXAGGERATED MIDDLE FINGER TO DOOM. I JUST MIGHT BE LEANING INTO A TASTE FOR THE LURID THAT AN UNDERCURRENT OF THREAT AND DREAD CAN INSPIRE. BUBBLEGUM PINK AND ALARM RED THIGH HIGH BOOTS AND LEATHER MICRO- SHORT CUTOFFS ADD A GARISH NOTE, BUT THESE MICRO-SHORTS CAN BE TRANSFORMED INTO WAIST DEFINING BELTS WITH HANDY POCKETS THAT CAN BE WORN OVER SIMPLE JERSEY SHIFTS. ALSO MORE CIVILIZED ARE ARCHITECTURAL COTTON POPLIN TUNICS AND ROBES WITH SCULPTED CAPES AND MANTLES IN BONDED WOOLS AND COTTON POPLIN. CONFECTIONS IN SILK CHIFFON WITH STRICT LINES OF TULLE GEO-RUFFLES SPRINKLED WITH TRAILING GAZAR RIBBONS ADD A GRIM GAIETY.

NOTES . THIS WILL BE OUR FOURTH AND LAST COVID ERA SHOW SET ON THE VENEZIA LIDO BEACH WHERE I LIVE HALF THE YEAR AND WHERE MY TEAM CAN JOIN ME FROM OUR FACTORY A SHORT DRIVE AWAY. DOING LIVE SHOWS HERE FELT LIKE THE RIGHT THING TO DO DURING THIS STRAINED MOMENT — IT FELT REDUCED, INTIMATE, HONEST AND RAW — DOING LIVE STREAM SHOWS ON THE BEACH IN FRONT OF MY HOUSE FELT LIKE A RETREAT BUT NOT A DEFEAT. WITH A POST-COVID IN VIEW THERE MIGHT BE A SENSE OF FRUSTRATED APPETITES DEMANDING TO BE DOUBLY SATISFIED THIS SUMMER THAT MIGHT MAKE FOR A VORACIOUSNESS FORGETTING THE HUMBLING EXPERIENCE WE ALL JUST WENT THROUGH TOGETHER. THIS COLLECTION EMBRACES HEDONISM BUT IN A SOFT, GRATEFUL WAY REFLECTING THIS NEW PERIOD OF CONTRADICTIVELY TRYING TO MIX GLAM WITH RESPONSIBILITY AND THOUGHTFULNESS. WHITE-MAGIC-HOUSES-OF-THE-HOLY-STAIRWAY-TO-HEAVEN HIPPIES WEAR BAGGY, DRAGGING FLARES OVER PLATFORMS, WITH ECO COTTON DISCO BODYSUIT/BATHERS (ECODISCO!) UNDER TRANSPARENT SHIRTS OR TRANSPARENTLY TAILORED MONSTER-SHOULDERED BLAZERS AND COATS. MY COMFORT LEVEL WITH OUR TAILORING CREW HAS LET ME REALLY SAVOR DEVELOPING THE INTERIOR STRUCTURAL PROCESS… AND EXPOSING IT… AND CELEBRATING ITS CONFECTION. WE SLICED INTO OUR COATS AND JKTS, RIPPING OFF SLEEVES, DEEPENING ARMHOLES, CUTTING AWAY FRONTS AND BACKS AND RENDERING EVERYTHING IN UNDYED COTTON ORGANDIES AND UNDYED SILK CHIFFONS THAT EXPOSE THE COMPLEXITY OF THE STRUCTURAL INTERLININGS BENEATH. THE DRAGGING DENIMS ARE IN 16OZ BLACK, NATURAL, OR ORANGE SELVEDGE DENIM CUSTOM WOVEN FOR US BY YAMAASHI ORIMONO (EST. 1945) ON VINTAGE SAKAMOTO SHUTTLE LOOMS. THIS IS FROM AN ONGOING DRKSHW CAPSULE MADE IN KURASHIKI, OKAYAMA PREFECTURE, JAPAN. DENIMS NOT COMING FROM OUR JAPAN CAPSULE ARE GOTS (GLOBAL ORGANIC TEXTILE STANDARD) CERTIFIED ORGANIC COTTON FROM A LOCAL ITALIAN MILL FOUNDED IN 1597. SNAP FRONT SHIRTS (THIS GENERATION’S BLAZER!), COME IN CHIFFON, CRISP COTTON, AND A TRANSPARENT FOG NYLON ALSO USED TO MAKE DIAPHANOUS FOG HOODIES. A HAND-KNOTTED BLANCHED COQ FEATHER JKT IS PRODUCED BY MAISON FÉVRIER (EST 1929), THE LAST OPERATING PLUMASSIER IN PARIS, WHO ONCE DID PIECES FOR JOSEPHINE BAKER. BRUTALIST CHOKERS ARE FROM AN ONGOING JEWELRY COLLECTION PRODUCED BY GOOSSENS, THE MAISON THAT ONCE PRODUCED JEWELRY FOR COCO CHANEL, CRISTOBAL BALENCIAGA, AND MADAME GRÈS IN THE 1950S. PERSONAL NON-TOXIC FOG MACHINES COME IN 3 SIZES — SMALL TO INSERT IN THE SIDE POCKETS ADDED TO OUR PLATFORM BOOTS… A CARRY-ON SIZE… AND A COFFEE TABLE SIZE. WE CONTINUE INCLUDING JKTS AND BAGS IN PIRARUCU DRAGON SCALE LEATHER, A FOOD BYPRODUCT PRODUCED BY INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES IN BRAZIL. DURING THESE LIDO SHOWS, WE MADE FRIENDS WITH SWAMPGOD, A YOUNG CREATOR WHO LIVES DOWN THE BEACH FROM ME, AND I INVITED HIM TO COME VISIT THE FACTORY AND RIP OLD STOCK APART TO RECONFIGURE THEM INTO NEW PIECES THAT END UP BEING DECONSTRUCTIONS OF MY DECONSTRUCTIONS, SOME INCLUDED IN THIS COLLECTION. HE ALSO AGREED TO MODEL FOR THIS SHOW. ALL OUR COTTON JERSEYS ARE WOVEN FROM GOTS CERTIFIED ORGANIC COTTON. LANGUID SHIRTS AND PANTS ARE IN BIODEGRADABLE COTTON WASTE CUPRO OR FSC CERTIFIED VISCOSE. OBVIOUSLY, WE/I STILL HAVE A WAYS TO GO TOWARDS OUR SUSTAINABILITY EFFORTS BUT WE ALL CAN AIM HIGHER AND START SOMEWHERE. THE SOUNDTRACK IS A CUSTOM DERANGED MIX BY MOCHIPET — A DISTORTED HALLUCINOGENIC SOUNDSCAPE THAT CAPTURES THE WARPED PERIOD OF HEDONISM COMING UP. IT’S GONNA BE A GLUTTONOUS SUMMER, STAY SAFE. ",

AFTER FOUR COVID ERA SHOWS LIVESTREAMED FROM MY HOME ON VENEZIA’S LIDO BEACH, RETURNING BOMBASTICALLY AT FULL BLAST TO THE PALAIS DE TOKYO PARVIS SEEMED TO IGNORE THE HUMBLING EXPERIENCE WE ALL WENT THROUGH TOGETHER; AND ARE STILL EXPERIENCING. THOSE COVID SHOWS WERE ABOUT DEFIANT FEROCITY IN THE FACE OF ADVERSITY BUT SHOULD RETURNING TO THE PARIS RUNWAYS BE ABOUT HUMILITY AND A LESSON LEARNED? OR CARPE DIEM? .
