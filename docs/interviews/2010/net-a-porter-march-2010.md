# NET-A-PORTER – MARCH 2010
## MARCH 2010 

<br><br>
<b>THIS SEASON HAS SEEN A RETURN TO PARED-BACK, NO FUSS, MINIMALIST PERFECTIONISM. WHY IS THIS SO RIGHT FOR NOW? </b>
<br><br>
WHEN WAS IT EVER NOT RIGHT? PERSONALLY, I'VE ALWAYS BEEN CRAZY ABOUT AN ALMOST BRUTAL MINIMALISM. IT'S SUCH A GREAT 'NO' TO CHAOS.
<br><br>
<b>DESCRIBE THE MOOD OF THIS LOOK.</b>
<br><br>
RATIONALISM. A GRACEFUL, CONFIDENT LINE FROM POINT A TO POINT B.
<br><br>
<b>IT FEELS LIKE A RETURN TO A VERY CLEAN, SHARP '90S SILHOUETTE. WHO EPITOMIZED THIS LOOK FOR YOU THEN AND WHO DOES NOW?</b>
<br><br>
WELL, WE ALL LOVED MR. LANG IN THE '90S BUT I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYONE REALLY COMMIT TO IT NOW.
<br><br>
<b>WHAT DO YOU THINK ARE THE KEY PIECES OF THIS TREND AND HOW SHOULD YOU WEAR THEM?</b>
<br><br>
PERSONALLY, I FEEL LIKE WEARING A LONG JACKET IN CRISP BLACK WITH A SHARP SHOULDER.
<br><br>
<b>WHAT ARE THE KEY COLORS AND FABRICS FOR THIS LOOK?</b>
<br><br>
WELL, YOU KNOW I'M GONNA SAY BLACK AND BLACK LEATHER.
<br><br>
<b>WHAT MADE YOU TAKE THE MINIMALIST DIRECTION THIS SEASON? WHAT INSPIRED YOU?</b>
<br><br>
ACTUALLY, I GOT A LITTLE MORE EMBELLISHED THAN USUAL WITH LACING DETAILS IN HEAVY CORD. I WAS THINKING ART DECO SAMURAI PRIESTESS.
<br><br>
<b>WHICH '90S FILM ICONS WOULD YOU REFERENCE AS INSPIRATION FOR THIS TREND?</b>
<br><br>
