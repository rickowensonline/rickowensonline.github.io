# LURVE – FEBRUARY 2010 - INTERVIEW WITH MICHELE LAMY
## FEBRUARY 2010

<br><br></p>
<p><b>TO WHICH EXTENT DO YOU FIND A COMPATIBILITY BETWEEN YOUR RATHER SHARP, CONTEMPORARY DESIGNS, AND THE POSH NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE THE BRAND IS PHYSICALLY SOLD AND CREATED?</b><br />
<br />
IT'S OUR THEME: ALWAYS MIX THE OLD WITH THE NEW. IF WE COULD MINGLE WITH THE ANTIQUE EGYPTIANS WE WOULD. TIMES EVOLVE. THEY DON'T CHANGE. <br />
<br />
<b>EVEN THOUGH RICK CREATED A NEW MOVEMENT IN FASHION, AS WELL IN WOMENSWEAR AS IN MENSWEAR, DO YOU SUPPORT ALL THOSE DESIGNERS NOWADAYS THAT CLEARLY COPY HIS WORK?</b> <br />
<br />
DOESN'T THAT SAY THAT RICK IS RIGHT IN 'L'AIR DU TEMPS'? <br />
<br />
<b>HOW CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT THE BRAND IN ITSELF, WHILE STAYING INDEPENDENT, IS MUCH MORE FAMOUS THAN SOME OTHERS THOUGH OWNED BY INVESTORS?</b> <br />
<br />
TALENT MAKES YOU FAMOUS WHATEVER THE BUSINESS DEAL YOU CHOOSE. BUT IF YOU STAY INDEPENDENT, YOU GIVE YOURSELF THE MEANS TO GROW AS YOU WANT. <br />
<br />
<b>IF A TATTOO IS A MEANS OF EXPRESSING AND DEVOTING ONESELF, DO YOU FEEL THAT WEARING CLOTHES IS THE TANGIBLE CONTINUITY OF THIS AIM?</b> <br />
<br />
IT'S ON THE SAME LEVEL. TATTOOS ON MY FINGERS, RINGS AROUND IT, FUR SOCKS, BLACK TANK TOP—SAME STORY. <br />
<br />
<b>INSOFAR AS RICK OWEN'S DESIGNS ARE LIKE A SCULPTURE BECOMING ALIVE WHEN WORN, HAVE YOU EVER FELT THAT YOUR PURPOSE WAS MORE THAT OF AN ARTIST THAN OF A MERCANTILE BUSINESS?</b> <br />
<br />
IT'S VERY REAL AND EXCITING. ALL CIVILIZATIONS DEVELOP ON THE MARKET PLACE. ONLY BAD WILL BE FEELING PRESSURE TO DO SOMETHING YOU DON'T WANT. ARTIST OR MERCHANT—ALL THE SAME. <br />
<br />
<b>DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE A STYLE ICON FOR LOTS OF PEOPLE?</b> <br />
<br />
FASHION ICON? I DONT THINK SO. BEING ON THE WILD SIDE—HEARD IT SINCE SKIING WHEN 12 COVERED IN KNOTTED FOX SKINS. <br />
<br />
<b>HAVE YOU EVER FELT A PRESSURE TO LOOK GOOD ALL THE TIME?</b> <br />
<br />
WHEN I DONT FEEL GOOD, PUT MY GLOVES ON, GO BOXING WITH STAIV THE TRAINER. PUNCH AND PUNCH AND PUNCH IT OUT. LIFE IS FINE. <br />
<br />
<b>DO YOU THINK THAT SOME DESIGNERS WORKING FOR BIG COUTURE HOUSES ARE THE REFLECTION OF A CERTAIN SENSE OF FRUSTRATION?</b> <br />
<br />
THEY ARE JUST 'DEMODE.' WHAT DOES NOT TRANSLATE AS OUT OF FASHION/BUT NO MORE IN THE RIGHT TRACK IF WE TALK OLYMPICS. <br />
<br />
<b>DO YOU STILL LOVE FASHION?</b> <br />
<br />
