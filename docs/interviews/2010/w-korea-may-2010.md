# W KOREA – MAY 2010
## MAY 2010

<br><br></p>
<p><b>DID YOU ENJOY YOUR BREAK AFTER FINISHING THE COLLECTION SUCCESSFULLY?</b> <br />
<br />
I WENT TO JORDAN TO FLOAT IN THE DEAD SEA. IT'S BEEN A LONG WINTER AND I NEEDED SUN. GOING SOMEPLACE ANCIENT WAS A BIG PLUS. I WENT TO THE CAVES OF PETRA AT DAWN AND IT WAS MAGICAL. EVERY CHANCE I GET, I GO TO A BEACH. IT'S SOOTHING, CENTERING AND STABILIZING ALL AT THE SAME TIME. <br />
<br />
<b>THE HARMONY OF CLOTHING, HAIR, MAKEUP, AND MUSIC MADE THIS COLLECTION SURPRISINGLY POWERFUL. I REMEMBER YOU ONCE SAYING YOU DON'T WANT WOMEN TO LOOK ANGRY OR AGGRESSIVE. BUT AT THIS COLLECTION, WOMEN LOOKED LIKE WARRIORS.</b> <br />
<br />
I KNOW! THEY ALWAYS END UP LOOKING LIKE AN ARMY! I MEAN FOR THEM TO LOOK MORE LIKE A SECT OR A TRIBE, UNIFIED TOWARDS A COMMUNAL IDEAL GOAL IN CEREMONIAL DRESS, BUT I HAVE TO ADMIT, THEY ENDED UP LOOKING EVEN MORE FEROCIOUS THIS TIME. BUT TO ME, AGGRESSIVE MUSIC AND FLAMBOYANCE ARE AN EXPRESSION OF JOY AND EXHILARATION. <br />
<br />
<b>THE ARMOR-LIKE OUTFIT MADE OF HORNS, AND THE STRUCTURES THAT LOOKED WRAPPED AND SECURED WERE UNIQUE. DOES THIS ALSO STAND FOR THE PROTECTION AND ISOLATION WHICH ARE THE BASES OF YOUR DESIGNS? IF SO, WHAT WOULD IT BE PROTECTED AND ISOLATED FROM?</b> <br />
<br />
AT THIS POINT IN MY LIFE, THE PROTECTION AND ISOLATION WOULD BE FROM CHAOS AND NEGATIVE DISTRACTION. I LIKE PUTTING THE IDEA OF DISCIPLINE, STILLNESS AND LOGIC OUT THERE—I WONDER IF I DO. THE HORN PIECES WERE ACTUALLY MY INTERPRETATION OF SEQUINS. BUT SEQUINS BY LE CORBUSIER OR BRANCUSI. <br />
<br />
<b>YOUR CLOTHING LOOKS DIFFICULT BUT IS ACTUALLY VERY EASY AND WEARABLE. I HEARD THAT THEY ARE ALREADY GETTING BACK POSITIVE RESPONSES IN KOREA. HOW MUCH DO YOU GIVE CONSIDERATION TO THE COMMERCIAL PARTS?</b> <br />
<br />
I WANT MY CLOTHES TO BE WORN. I WANT THEM TO BE A VIABLE OPTION, NOT A CONCEPTUAL INDULGENCE. BEING ABLE TO SLIGHTLY CHANGE HOW PEOPLE THINK ABOUT DRESSING IN EVERYDAY LIFE IS SO MUCH MORE PROFOUND TO ME THAN MAKING THINGS TO ONLY WEAR ONCE. <br />
<br />
<b>ALTHOUGH YOUR PIECES ARE WEARABLE, IT SEEMS THAT THERE ARE NOT MANY WOMEN WHO CAN REALLY LOOK GOOD IN YOUR CLOTHING. WHICH KIND OF WOMEN WOULD YOU LIKE IN YOUR CLOTHING?</b> <br />
<br />
I WOULD LIKE MY CLOTHES TO BE FOR EVERYONE. I WANT TO CREATE AN INCLUSIVE WORLD, NOT AN EXCLUSIVE ONE. <br />
