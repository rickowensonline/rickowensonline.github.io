# VOGUE AUSTRALIA – FEBRUARY 2010
## FEBRUARY 2010

<br><br></p>
<p><b>WHAT IS YOUR GOLDEN RULE WHEN IT COMES TO STYLE?</b> <br />
<br />
THE MAIN RULE IS NOT TO WORRY ABOUT RULES. I WOULD NEVER IMPOSE MY PERSONAL VISION, WHICH IS NICHE AT BEST. HOWEVER. I MIGHT OFFER SUGGESTIONS. ONE SUGGESTION MIGHT BE: NEVER TRY TO BE SOMEONE YOU'RE JUST NOT. LOVE WHO YOU ARE. <br />
<br />
<b>WHAT IS THE ONE ITEM THAT NO WARDROBE SHOULD BE WITHOUT?</b> <br />
<br />
A WORN BLACK LEATHER JACKET. IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE A WARDROBE OF WHITE T-SHIRTS. <br />
<br />
<b>WHAT WOULD YOU SAY MAKES THE PERFECT T-SHIRT?</b> <br />
<br />
I LIKE A WHITE T-SHIRT IN THIN 100% COTTON WITH A COORDINATING RIB NECK-BINDING. I FIND THAT COTTON DRAPES MORE MODESTLY THAN A SILK OR VISCOSE, WHICH CLINGS MORE. <br />
<br />
<b>WHAT DETAILS SHOULD YOU LOOK FOR?</b> <br />
<br />
I LIKE TUBULAR KNITS WITHOUT A SEAM. OR ONE SEAM GOING DOWN THE BACK, LIKE MINE. <br />
<br />
<b>WHAT DOES IT SAY ABOUT YOU?</b> <br />
<br />
I LIKE TO THINK IT SUGGESTS COMFORT WITH ONE'S PHYSICALITY AND PRACTICAL FUNCTIONALITY. <br />
<br />
<b>DO YOU THINK STYLE IS SOMETHING YOU CAN BUY, OR LEARN, OR IS IT SOMETHING YOU ARE BORN WITH?</b> <br />
<br />
ANYONE, ANYONE, ANYONE CAN INVENT THEMSELVES. WITH GROOMING, A FIT BODY AND A GENEROUS SPIRIT, ANYONE CAN CREATE ALLURE. <br />
<br />
<b>HOW DO YOU ENSURE THAT YOU ARE NEITHER OVERDRESSED NOR UNDERDRESSED?</b> <br />
<br />
HAVE THE CONFIDENCE TO ACCEPT WHO YOU ARE AND RELAX. AND I DON'T THINK YOU CAN EVER OVERDRESS. <br />
<br />
<b>HOW DO YOU ENSURE THAT YOUR LOOK IS ALWAYS INTERESTING AND NEVER DULL?</b> <br />
<br />
I THINK LOOKING INTERESTING MIGHT BE OVERRATED. <br />
<br />
<b>IF IT IMPORTANT TO BE TRUE TO YOURSELF IN TERMS OF YOUR WARDROBE, WHAT ARE YOUR TIPS TO ACHIEVE THIS?</b> <br />
<br />
