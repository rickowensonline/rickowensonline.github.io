# VOGUE UK – FEBRUARY 2010
## FEBRUARY 2010

<br><br></p>
<p><b>YOUR FAVOURITE HOTEL?</b> <br />
<br />
I GO TO THE EXCELSIOR LIDO IN VENICE EVERY YEAR. THE ROOMS ARE LIKE BIG '50S CARTOON MOORISH FANTASIES, AND I FEEL LIKE ASCHENBACH ON THE BEACH WITH HAIR DYE DRIPPING DOWN MY FACE IN 'DEATH IN VENICE.' <br />
<br />
<b>YOUR FAVOURITE FASHION BOUTIQUES?</b> <br />
<br />
I LIKE THE AUSTERITY AND ALMOST HOSTILE SILENCE AT THE COMME DES GARCONS SHOP ON RUE DU FAUBOURG ST. HONORE. IT'S ALWAYS A DELIGHT LOOKING AT THOSE CLOTHES AND I ALWAYS PICK UP BOTTLES OF AVIGNON INCENSE PARFUM. <br />
<br />
<b>YOUR FAVOURITE JEWELLERY STORE?</b> <br />
<br />
NAILA DE MONBRISON ON RUE DE BOURGOGNE IS THE MOST PERFECT SHOP I KNOW. I LOVE THE BEIGE COLOR OF THE CURTAIN IN THE WINDOW, THE LITTLE CASES IN THE WALL AND THE INDUSTRIAL METAL FITTINGS. IT FEELS LIKE A LITTLE ESOTERIC CORNER DESIGNED BY PIERRE CHAREAU. AND THE JEWELRY IS BOLD, BARBARIC AND RADICAL. <br />
<br />
<b>YOUR FAVOURITE PERFUME/FRAGRANCE SHOP?</b> <br />
<br />
WHEN I CAME TO PARIS THE FIRST TIME AROUND 25 YEARS AGO, THE FIRST PLACE I WENT TO WAS THE SERGE LUTENS PARFUM SHOP IN THE PALAIS ROYAL. IT WAS ONE OF THE FEW PLACES YOU COULD GET SOMETHING UNAVAILABLE ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD. I LOVED HOW HE CREATED HIS OWN MYTHOLOGY OF BEAUTIFULLY EXAGGERATED CREATURES FLOATING IN HIS VERY PERSONAL UNIVERSE. IT FELT LIKE A DIVINE DESTINY TO OPEN MY SHOP NEXT TO IT MANY YEARS LATER. <br />
<br />
<b>YOUR FAVOURITE HOME FURNISHINGS STORE?</b> <br />
<br />
I LOVE GALERIE ERIC PHILIPPE IN GALERIE VERO-DODAT. HE CARRIES THE MOST BEAUTIFULLY EDITED SELECTION OF 20TH CENTURY SWEDISH AND DANISH FURNITURE; UNUSUAL PIECES FROM THE SWEDISH GRACE MOVEMENT. <br />
<br />
<b>YOUR FAVOURITE MUSEUMS?</b> <br />
<br />
WHEN FRIENDS COME TO PARIS, I LIKE TO TAKE THEM TO THE GUSTAVE MOREAU MUSEUM. I LIKE BEING ABLE TO GO THROUGH HIS PERSONAL ROOMS AND ESPECIALLY ENJOY THE LAYERS OF PAINTINGS DISPLAYED IN HIS STUDIO. I LOVE THE HEAVINESS OF THE THICK LAYERS OF MELODRAMATIC SYMBOLISM; ALL THE SALOMES AND SEBASTIANS AND ANGELS OF GOMORRA. IT MAKES YOU DIZZY LIKE TOO MUCH INCENSE AND PERFUME. <br />
<br />
<b>YOUR FAVOURITE FINE FOODS STORE AND DELICATESSEN?</b> <br />
<br />
I LIKE THE BEAUTIFUL LITTLE CAKES AT PATISSERIE PAIN DE SUCRE ON RUE RAMBUTEAU. THE WAY THEY PUT STUFF TOGETHER IS LIKE VICTOR AND ROLF AND CHRISTIAN LACROIX IN THE KITCHEN. <br />
<br />
<b>YOUR FAVOURITE RESTAURANTS?</b> <br />
<br />
I LIKE WALKING THROUGH THE AIR FRANCE BUS STATION IN THE INVALIDES TO GET TO RESTAURANT CHEZ FRANCOIS UNDERNEATH IT—UNEXPECTEDLY COZY WITH BIG BANQUETTES, MISMATCHED PILLOWS, PLENTY OF FLOWERS AND A PIANO BY THE BAR. <br />
<br />
AND THE AMERICAN IN ME IS ALWAYS IMPRESSED WITH THE EXTRAVAGANT AND BEAUTIFULLY TATTERED INTERIORS OF LE TRAIN BLEU. I ALWAYS THINK OF MAGGIE SMITH THERE IN A SCENE FROM ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES, 'TRAVELS WITH MY AUNT.' <br />
<br />
<b>BEST PLACE FOR A LATE EVENING DRINK?</b> <br />
<br />
I LIKE THE ENERGY AT LE MATHIS AFTER I HAVE DINNER THERE. THE TABLES START MOVING AROUND AND A NEW GROUP STARTS COMING IN. AS I'M LEAVING, I FEEL LIKE SOMETHING DELICIOUSLY ILLICIT IS GOING TO HAPPEN AS SOON AS I'M GONE. <br />
<br />
<b>YOUR FAVOURITE NIGHTCLUB?</b> <br />
<br />
I LIKE THE MUSIC AT THE REX. I WAKE UP AT 3 AM, HAVE AN ESPRESSO AND GO THERE TO DANCE FOR A FEW HOURS. LIKE WAKING UP EARLY TO GO JOGGING. <br />
<br />
<b>BEST FLORIST?</b> <br />
<br />
