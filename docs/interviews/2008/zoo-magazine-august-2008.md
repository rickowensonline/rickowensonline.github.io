# ZOO MAGAZINE – AUGUST 2008
## AUGUST 2008 

ZOO MAGAZINE – AUGUST 2008</b>
<br><br></p>
<p><b>YOUR LAST WOMEN'S SHOW WAS VERY POWERFUL. IT MANAGED TO COMBINE EXTREME LUXURY WITH A BARBARIC EDGE. IN WHAT WAYS DID LEE BONTECOU'S WORK INSPIRE YOU?</b> <br />
<br />
IT WASN'T TOO DEEP. WE'RE FROM THE SAME TONAL FAMILY OF COLORS. SHE JUST REMINDED ME TO USE DENIM. <br />
<br />
<b>YOUR STYLE HAS OFTEN BEEN DESCRIBED AS 'EDGY' OR 'AVANT-GARDE' YET YOUR CLOTHES ARE INCREDIBLY SENSUAL AND EASY TO WEAR. HOW DO YOU STRIKE THAT BALANCE?</b> <br />
<br />
I THINK THAT PLAYING WITH SHAPE INSTEAD OF SURFACE ORNAMENTATION IS SOMETIMES MISTAKEN FOR AVANT-GARDE. <br />
<br />
AND REGARDING WEARABILITY, I HAVE A HUGE PRACTICAL STREAK THAT I CAN'T SUPRESS AS MUCH AS I'D LIKE TO. <br />
<br />
<b>YOUR COLLECTIONS ARE OFTEN ANDROGYNOUS AND HAVE AN AMBIGUOUS FEEL WHICH IS PART OF YOUR AESTHETIC. WHAT ROLE DOES SEXUALITY PLAY IN YOUR WORK?</b> <br />
<br />
ABSOLUTELY EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE DESIRED. EVERYBODY. BY ANYONE. IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. <br />
<br />
<b>WHAT IS THE STARTING POINT FOR YOU WHEN YOU DESIGN? DO YOU HAVE ANY SPECIFIC RITUALS OR DOES INSPIRATION COME FROM UNEXPECTED SOURCES?</b> <br />
<br />
I LOVE LOOKING AT ARCHITECTURE. IT'S ASPIRATIONAL BUT IMPOSSIBLE TO COMPARE TO MY LITTLE JOB, THUS NOT DISTURBING MY STUPID EGO OR VANITY. <br />
<br />
<b>WHAT WAS YOUR DREAM JOB WHEN YOU WERE A CHILD? AND WHY DID YOU DECIDE TO GO INTO FASHION?</b> <br />
<br />
I JUST WANTED TO BE BAD-ASS AND GLAMOROUS. <br />
<br />
<b>YOU SET UP YOUR LABEL IN 1994 AND HAVE BEEN DESIGNING FOR ALMOST 15 YEARS. WHAT WERE THE HIGHS AND LOWS OF YOUR CAREER?</b> <br />
<br />
I DON'T REMEMBER ANY SPECIFIC LOWS, JUST A DULL SENSE OF SCRAPING ALONG. LATER, I DO REMEMBER HEARING MY FAVORITE SISTERS OF MERCY SONG WHILE I WAS BEING DRIVEN TO MY FACTORY THROUGH THE FOGGY ITALIAN COUNTRYSIDE EARLY ONE MORNING AND FINDING MYSELF CRYING. I WAS HEARING THAT SONG UNDER SUCH DIFFERENT CONDITIONS THAN WHEN I FIRST USED TO HEAR IT IN MY YOUNGER DAYS. <br />
<br />
<b>HOW DO YOU THINK FASHION HAS CHANGED SINCE YOU STARTED? HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THAT EVOLUTION?</b> <br />
<br />
EVEN IN MY RELATIVELY SHORT EXPERIENCE IT'S ACCELERATED. AND EVERY COMPANY'S STRATEGIES AND MACHINATIONS ARE COMPLETELY EXPOSED. EVERY CONSUMER IS COMPLETELY AWARE OF EVERY MEASURE BEING TAKEN TO SEDUCE THEM. <br />
<br />
SO THE METHODS OF SEDUCTION NEED TO SHIFT. AND EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE SEDUCED. I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE HOW IT'S GONNA CHANGE, BUT I'M WATCHING. <br />
<br />
<b>HOW IMPORTANT IS BEAUTY TO YOU? WHAT IS IT THAT ATTRACTS YOU IN A PERSON?</b> <br />
<br />
ANYONE, ANYONE CAN BE WILDLY ATTRACTIVE BY MAKING THEMSELVES FIT, BY GROOMING, AND BY HAVING AN OPEN HEART AND AN EASY LAUGH. <br />
<br />
<b>HOW DO YOU ENVISAGE THE INTERACTION BETWEEN YOUR FURNITURE DESIGN, PHOTOGRAPHY AND FASHION WORK? DO ALL FIELDS FEED EACH OTHER?</b> <br />
<br />
YEAH, IT'S ALL ONE BIG PACKAGE, FOR BETTER OR WORSE. <br />
<br />
<b>DO YOU CONSIDER YOUR WORK PERSONAL OR AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL? AND IF SO, IN WHICH WAYS?</b> <br />
<br />
IF I EXPLAINED THAT, I'D RUIN ANY POETRY IN IT. <br />
<br />
<b>YOUR RELATIONSHIP TO MICHELE LAMY HAS BEEN PIVOTAL IN YOUR LIFE AND CAREER. IN WHAT WAYS IS SHE UNIQUE AND INDISPENSABLE?</b> <br />
<br />
I HAVE WONDERFUL BUSINESS PARTNERS BUT MICHELE FILLS ANOTHER, MORE SUBTLE ROLE; SHE'S ABOUT REFINEMENTS AND LOOKING UPWARD AND ONWARDS. AND REMINDING ME TO EAT AND PLAY. I THANK MY STARS FOR HER EVERY DAY. <br />
<br />
<b>ARE THERE ANY ARTISTS, FILMMAKERS OR MUSICIANS YOU ALWAYS SEEM TO GO BACK TO? AND WHO ARE THE ONES THAT CURRENTLY EXCITE YOU THE MOST?</b> <br />
<br />
OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD: BRANCUSI, JEAN MICHEL-FRANK, COLANI, RUHLMANN, CHAREAU, HUYSMANS, DIVINE, BRODOVITCH, WAGNER, IAN KEIR, AUTECHRE, OLD SCHOOL HOUSE MUSIC, AC/DC, SATYAJIT RAY, CHARLOTTE RAMPLING, KLAUS NOMI. <br />
<br />
<b>ARE THERE ANY OBJECTS OR PLACES THAT YOU CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT?</b> <br />
<br />
NO. <br />
<br />
<b>WHAT ARE YOUR HOPES FOR THE FUTURE? DO YOU STILL HAVE MANY DREAMS THAT ARE NOT FULFILLED?</b> <br />
<br />
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO ENDING UP PLAYING WITH A KITTEN IN A WALLED GARDEN. <br />
<br />
<b>WHAT IS YOUR ESCAPE PLAN WHEN IT ALL BECOMES TOO MUCH? WHERE DO YOU FIND REFUGE? </b><br />
<br />
