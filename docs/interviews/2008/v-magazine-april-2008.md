# V MAGAZINE – APRIL 2008
## APRIL 2008

<br><br></p>
<p><b>HOW MANY SQUARE FEET IS THE NEW YORK STORE?</b> <br />
<br />
2,000 SQUARE FEET. <br />
<br />
<b>WAS IT THE FIRST PLACE YOU LOOKED AT?</b> <br />
<br />
YES. <br />
<br />
<b>APART FROM LOCATION, WHAT WILL BE THE MAIN DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS STORE AND THE ONE IN PARIS?</b> <br />
<br />
THE PARIS STORE IS MORE INTIMATE AND INSULATED, UPHOLSTERED AND LOOKING ONTO WHAT'S ESSENTIALLY A WALLED GARDEN. THERE'S A HIDDEN QUALITY TO IT. THE NEW YORK STORE IS HIGH CEILINGED, ON A CORNER WITH BIG WINDOWS LOOKING ONTO A KIND OF BARREN VIEW. IT FEELS MORE EXPOSED IN AN EMPTY LANDSCAPE. <br />
<br />
<b>ARE YOU COLLABORATING ON THE INTERIOR DESIGN?</b> <br />
<br />
I APPROACHED ARCHITECTS, BUT REALIZED THAT MY REQUIREMENTS WERE SO SPECIFIC THAT I WAS INSULTING THEM. I'M NOT TOO GREAT AT COLLABORATION. IT'LL BE PRETTY SIMPLE, REALLY. A WALL OF FOG AND A ROCK TO SIT ON. I WAS THINKING OF A BIG CAVE. <br />
<br />
<b>WHAT MADE YOU CHOOSE THE NEIGHBORHOOD?</b> <br />
<br />
I WAS DOUBLE CONVINCED OF THE LOCATION WHEN I REALIZED THAT MY FAVORITE CLUB, SHELTER, IS A BLOCK AWAY. I LOVE WAKING UP EARLY SUNDAY MORNING, GULPING A COFFEE AND GOING THERE FOR THEIR AFTER-HOURS. THE WINDOWS ARE BLACKED OUT, THE FOG MACHINE IS PUMPING AND IT'S PACKED BUT NOT TOO PACKED. IT'S VERY MELLOW OLD SCHOOL. LAST TIME, I LEFT AT 1 PM AND IT WAS STILL GOING STRONG. I LOVE THE PERVERSITY OF DENYING MORNING AND PLUNGING INTO THE DARK ON A COFFEE BUZZ. <br />
<br />
<b>FIRST PARIS, NOW NYC—WHICH CITY IS NEXT FOR A STORE OPENING?</b> <br />
<br />
