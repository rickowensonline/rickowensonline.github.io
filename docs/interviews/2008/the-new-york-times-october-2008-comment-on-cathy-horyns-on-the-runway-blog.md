# THE NEW YORK TIMES – OCTOBER 2008 – COMMENT ON CATHY HORYN'S 'ON THE RUNWAY' BLOG
## OCTOBER 2008

<br><br></p>
<p>I'M APPALLED AT RICK OWENS, THE ATTENTION THOSE GRIM RAGS GET AND THE GLOWING REVIEWS OF HIS VISIONARY APPROACH AND MASTER TAILORING. THEY ARE PREMONITIONS OF THE MELTDOWN OF LIFE AND CULTURE THAT IS RIGHT AROUND THE NEXT CORNER. THEY ARE TROLL CLOTHES FOR THE MOST DESPERATE LEMMINGS IN THE FASHION HERD. IT'S ALWAYS SO INTERESTING TO ME THAT WHEN SOMETHING TRULY QUESTIONABLE IN VISION AND EXECUTION COMES DOWN THE PIKE, THE FIRST THING THE PRESS SAYS IS WHAT BRILLIANT TAILORING IT POSSESSES. WELL IT DOESN'T. SAVILLE ROW OR LOWER ORCHARD STREET HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. THE STARVING WILL EAT ANYTHING NOT MOVING TOO FAST, WHETHER ITS ANIMAL, MINERAL OR VEGETABLE.<br />
