# DAZED & CONFUSED JAPAN – NOVEMBER 2008
## NOVEMBER 2008

<br><br></p>
<p>MOVIES THAT INSPIRE DESIGNERS <br />
<br />
THE FIRST ONE THAT IMMEDIATELY COMES TO MIND IS 'PINK FLAMINGOS' BY JOHN WATERS. DIVINE REMINDS US ALL THAT WE CAN ALL BE GLORIOUS SELF-INVENTIONS. AND I LOVE THE MESSAGE OF CHEERFUL IMMORALITY AND NO BOUNDARIES. <br />
<br />
NEXT IS 'SALOME' DIRECTED BY ALLA NAZIMOVA, STARRING HERSELF IN HER FORTIES AS THE 15-YEAR-OLD PRINCESS WHO LUSTS AFTER A HOLY MAN AND AROUSES HER HORNY STEPFATHER INTO KILLING HIM FOR HER. A BLACK AND WHITE SILENT MOVIE YOU CAN WATCH WHILE LISTENING TO MONTSERRAT CABALLE SINGING THE FINALE OF THE OPERA 'SALOME.' BLACK LILY OVERDOSE ON PLANET AUBREY BEARDSLEY.<br />
I LOVE PASOLINI'S 'OEDIPUS REX': WHITE, WHITE, WHITE SILVANA MANGANO WITH '60S EYELINER AND SHAVED EYEBROWS IN ONE -SHOULDERED BURLAP ROBES IN THE DESERT.<br />
OF COURSE I LOVE CECIL B. DEMILLE'S 'CLEOPATRA.' EVERY SINGLE LITTLE DETAIL IS OVER THE TOP AND DRAAAAGGING SOMETHING OVER THE TOP BY THE TAIL OF ITS OVER-THE-TOPNESS.<br />
