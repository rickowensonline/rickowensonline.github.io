# VOGUE UK – SEPTEMBER 2008
## SEPTEMBER 2008

<br><br></p>
<p><b>HOW WILL THE LONDON STORE DIFFER FROM THE PARIS STORE? HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THE CONCEPT?</b> <br />
<br />
WHEREAS THE PARIS STORE IS PLUSH AND INSULATED AND HIDDEN IN THE COLONNADES OF THE PALAIS ROYAL, THE LONDON STORE IS MORE OF A TOWNHOUSE WITH NICE HIGH CEILINGS. THERE'S MORE WHITE SPACE TO STRETCH OUT AND SHOW FURNITURE. THE PARIS STORE SHAMELESSLY HAS A WAX FIGURE OF ME IN THE CORNER AND THE LONDON STORE WILL FOLLOW SUIT WITH MY WAX HEAD ON A PLATE IN HOMAGE TO YOUR MR. WILDE'S 'SALOME,' MY FAVORITE OPERA. <br />
<br />
<b>HOW BIG WILL THE STORE BE?</b> <br />
<br />
250 SQUARE METERS. <br />
<br />
<b>WHAT RANGES WILL BE CARRIED IN STORE? MENS', WOMENS', ACCESSORIES, LILIES?</b> <br />
<br />
EVERYTHING RICK OWENS, INCLUDING FAVORITE THINGS I ORDER JUST FOR THE STORES: SPECIAL MINI-COLLECTIONS, MY FAVORITE DVDS AND TOYS, AND SELECTIONS FROM OTHER DESIGNER FRIENDS LIKE GARETH PUGH, OF COURSE. <br />
<br />
<b>WHAT IS YOUR FAVOURITE THING ABOUT LONDON?</b> <br />
<br />
