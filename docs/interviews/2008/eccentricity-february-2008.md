# ECCENTRICITY – FEBRUARY 2008
## FEBRUARY 2008 

<br><br></p>
<p>WHEN I WAS YOUNGER, I WANTED DESPERATELY TO BE ECCENTRIC BECAUSE IT IMPLIED INTELLECTUAL COMPLEXITY AND INDIVIDUALITY. NOW I REALIZE THAT I'M PRETTY AVERAGE AND THAT I DON'T HAVE THE ENERGY TO MAINTAIN THAT SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS ANYMORE. BUT, HAVING DONE THINGS MY OWN WAY ON MY OWN PLANET FOR SO LONG, I'VE HEARD THE WORD APPLIED TO ME. <br />
<br />
AUTHENTIC ECCENTRICITY, TO ME, SUGGESTS A LITTLE MENTAL IMBALANCE. WHICH I LOVE. BUT USUALLY, IT'S A SIMPLE CASE OF FLAMBOYANCE WHICH WE'RE DEFINITELY SHORT OF THESE DAYS. UNFORTUNATELY EVERYTHING TRANSGRESSIVE HAS BEEN DONE, SO THE MOST EXCLUSIVE TRANSGRESSIONS AND STATUS SYMBOLS HAVE BECOME SO REFINED AND SUBTLE THAT THEY'RE PRACTICALLY INVISIBLE. <br />
<br />
WE'LL NEED ANOTHER SEXUAL REVOLUTION OR OUTER SPACE INVASION TO GIVE OURSELVES THE EXCUSE TO SHOW OFF AGAIN. <br />
