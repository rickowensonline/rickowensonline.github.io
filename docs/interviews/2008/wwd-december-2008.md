# WWD – DECEMBER 2008
## DECEMBER 2008

<br><br></p>
<p><b>DO YOU HAVE ANY SURPRISES UP YOUR SLEEVE FOR IT?</b> <br />
<br />
I DON'T KNOW HOW ANYONE CAN BE SURPRISED BY ANYTHING ANYMORE. ISN'T IT SURPRISE ENOUGH THAT I'VE PICKED THE WORST FINANCIAL CLIMATE TO PROPOSE MEN'S FASHIONS? <br />
<br />
<b>WHAT CAN WE EXPECT?</b> <br />
<br />
WELL, JUST COME WITH AN OPEN MIND. <br />
<br />
<b>WHERE WILL IT BE HELD?</b> <br />
<br />
IT'LL BE AT SALLE MELPOMENE, AROUND THE CORNER FROM MY HOUSE. I CAN WALK THERE AND GO TO THE GYM AFTER. <br />
<br />
<b>WHY HAVE YOU DECIDED TO STAGE A SEPARATE MEN'S WEAR SHOW?</b> <br />
<br />
YEAH, WHY WOULD I WANT TO GIVE MYSELF ANOTHER JOB? WELL, THE MEN'S COLLECTION HAS TAKEN ON A LIFE OF ITS OWN AND NEEDS TO FULFILL ITS DESTINY. <br />
<br />
<b>COULD YOU DESCRIBE A COUPLE OF THE PIECES THAT WILL SHOW?</b> <br />
<br />
