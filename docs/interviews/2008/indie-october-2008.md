# INDIE – OCTOBER 2008
## OCTOBER 2008 

INDIE – OCTOBER 2008</b>
<br><br></p>
<p><b>WHAT ARE YOU CURRENTLY WORKING ON?</b> <br />
<br />
I'M LAUNCHING MEN'S F/W 09, WOMEN'S PRECOLLECTION 09, PALAIS ROYAL FURS, AND DRKSHDW DENIM COLLECTIONS TO BE IN OUR SHOWROOM FOR JANUARY SALES. <br />
<br />
<b>HOW IS YOUR BUSINESS ORGANISED? HOW MANY PEOPLE WORK FOR YOU AND WHO ARE YOUR PARTNERS?</b> <br />
<br />
I HAVE A BUSINESS PARTNER WHO RUNS MY COMPANY OWENSCORP, I HAVE A DISTRIBUTION PARTNER AND I HAVE A MANUFACTURING LICENSE. <br />
<br />
<b>PLEASE DESCRIBE YOUR FAMOUS HOUSE IN PARIS - THE PLACE WHERE YOU LIVE AND WORK.</b> <br />
<br />
IS IT FAMOUS? IT'S A 17TH CENTURY BUILDING LOOKING ONTO THE PLACE DU PALAIS BOURBON. IT'S GOT A TRADITIONAL GRAND FACADE AND 5 FLOORS OF CONCRETE '50S OFFICE BUILDING IN BACK OVERLOOKING THE GARDENS OF THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE. IT'S ALL BEEN STRIPPED AND LEFT RAW.<br />
<br />
<b>ARE YOU PROUD OF STILL BEEING AN INDEPENDENT DESIGNER?</b> <br />
<br />
SURE. <br />
<br />
<b>YOUR WORK SEEMS TO BE ONE EVOLVING PROCESS, NOT SEASON-RELATED. DOES IT BOTHER YOU SOMETIMES TO BE 'FORCED' TO PRESENT FOUR COLLECTIONS PER YEAR AT A CERTAIN POINT IN TIME?</b> <br />
<br />
I FIND IT STIMULATING. IT USED TO STRESS ME OUT AT THE BEGINNING BECAUSE I DID FEEL PRESSURED TO DO SOMETHING NEW ALL THE TIME. NOW I'VE REALIZED THAT I CAN DO IT HOWEVER I WANT. IT'S A PLEASURE TO REINTERPRET AND REFINE MY ORIGINAL CONCEPT. I DON'T KNOW IF PEOPLE WILL BE VERY INTERESTED IN THAT FOREVER, BUT I'M OK WITH THAT. <br />
<br />
<b>WHAT'S THE MAIN FUNCTION OF FASHION?</b> <br />
<br />
BEAUTY IS ONE OF LIFE'S GREATEST REWARDS. <br />
<br />
<b>ARE YOU INTERESTED IN THE WORK OF OTHER CONTEMPORARY FASHION DESIGNERS?</b> <br />
<br />
SURE. I'M A FASHION FAN. <br />
<br />
<b>WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE CURRENT 'CALIFORNIAN STYLE' EXEMPLIFIED BY CHRISTIAN AUDIGIER, WHICH IS SUPPORTED BY A LOT OF CELEBRITIES?</b> <br />
<br />
UNFAMILIAR WITH IT. <br />
<br />
<b>DOES THE PRESS INFLUENCE YOUR WORK?</b> <br />
<br />
PROBABLY. ANY CRITICISM, NO MATTER HOW FAR-FETCHED, USUALLY HAS A GRAIN OF TRUTH. WHY NOT LEARN FROM THAT? <br />
<br />
<b>WHAT INSPIRES YOU?</b> <br />
<br />
I LOOK AT ARCHITECTURE AND DESIGN BOOKS A LOT. CHARLOTTE PERRIAND, LOUIS KAHN, CARLO MOLLINO, JEAN MICHEL-FRANK, THAT KIND OF STUFF. THOSE TIMELESS PROPORTIONS ARE VERY SOOTHING AND PUT ME IN A RATIONAL FRAME OF MIND. <br />
<br />
<b>WHICH OTHER CREATIVE DISCIPLINES INFLUENCE YOUR WORK?</b> <br />
<br />
I LOOK AT ARTISTS LIKE PAUL KOOIKER, BRANCUSI, STEPHEN PARRINO, AND READ A LOT OF BIOGROPHIES LIKE STEPHEN TENNANT'S AND ROBERT DE MONTESQUIOU'S. <br />
<br />
<b>WHAT ABOUT MUSIC?</b> <br />
<br />
JULIE LONDON, DAVE CLARKE, KISS, MONTSERRAT CABALLE. <br />
<br />
<b>WHAT'S THE THEME OF YOUR NEXT COLLECTION?</b> <br />
<br />
CRUST. TEMPORARY PROTECTIVE COVERINGS THAT FALL OFF AND DECOMPOSE, REVEALING NEW STRENGTH UNDERNEATH. <br />
<br />
<b>YOU RECENTLY LAUNCHED YOUR FURNITURE COLLECTION. CAN YOU DESCRIBE THE PIECES AND YOUR CONCEPT BEHIND THE LINE?</b> <br />
<br />
I WANTED TO FURNISH MY HOUSE, BUT ALL THE RUHLMANN FURNITURE I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO FILL IT WITH WAS TOO EXPENSIVE, TOO SHINY AND TOO SMALL. SO I MADE MY OWN. <br />
<br />
<b>WHERE CAN PEOPLE BUY RICK OWENS FURNITURE?</b> <br />
<br />
I SELL IT THROUGH GALERIE JOUSSE IN PARIS. <br />
<br />
<b>COULD YOU IMAGINE STOPPING THE FASHION THING ONE DAY COMPLETELY TO CONCENTRATE ON INTERIORS OR ARCHITECTURE?</b> <br />
<br />
PROBABLY NOT. FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE, I'M ADDICTED TO THE FASHION PACE NOW. WAITING 7 YEARS TO GET A BUILDING UP WOULD FUCKING KILL ME. <br />
<br />
<b>DO YOU STILL WORK FOR REVILLON?</b> <br />
<br />
NO. THEY SIMPLY DIDN'T HAVE THE MONEY TO DO WHAT A LUXURY HOUSE HAS TO DO. AND MAYBE I WASN'T THE RIGHT PERSON FOR THEM TO ATTRACT INVESTORS WITH. WHO KNOWS. MAYBE THEIR NEXT STEP WILL BE A HUGE SUCCESS. <br />
<br />
<b>WHAT'S SO FASCINATING ABOUT FURS?</b> <br />
<br />
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT WORKING AS A DESIGNER FOR A MAISON WAS A SELLOUT FOR DESIGNERS AFRAID OF COMMITTING THEMSELVES TO THE RISK OF DOING THEIR OWN THING. BUT REVILLON WAS SPECIFICALLY A FRENCH FUR MAISON PEAKING IN FIN-DE-SIECLE PARIS: MY NE PLUS ULTRA OF RARIFIED ARTIFICE AND GLAMOUR. PROUST'S MOTHER AND SARAH BERNHARDT WORE REVILLON FURS. I COULDN'T RESIST. AND IF MARBLE IS A STEP BEYOND STONE FOR A SCULPTOR, FUR IS A STEP BEYOND LEATHER FOR A DESIGNER. THE TOUCH OF FUR IS A MIRACLE THAT CAN'T BE DUPLICATED. LIKE THE WARMTH OF WOOD OR THE RICHNESS OF A FISTFUL OF EARTH. <br />
<br />
<b>WHAT DO LUXURY AND DECAY MEAN TO YOU?</b> <br />
<br />
THERE'S A MOMENT JUST PAST ITS PEAK WHEN A FLOWER GIVES OFF ITS STRONGEST SCENT. ITS LAST GASP. THERE'S ALSO A MOMENT IN MOST OPERAS WHEN THE HEROINE'S ARIA REACHES A TRANSCENDENT PEAK WHERE THERE'S NOWHERE TO GO FROM, AND SHE DIES. I LIKE THAT IDEA OF EXTREME, ULTIMATE SENSATION. AND I LOVE THE RIDICULOUSNESS OF IT. <br />
<br />
<b>HOW DO YOU STAGE YOUR PERSONAL DECAY?</b> <br />
<br />
DO I STAGE IT OR HAS IT BECOME REAL? <br />
<br />
<b>PLEASE DEFINE 'BEAUTY.'</b> <br />
<br />
ONE OF LIFE'S GREAT MYSTERIES, LIKE LOVE AND DEATH. <br />
<br />
<b>ARE YOU AFRAID OF DEATH?</b> <br />
<br />
I THOUGHT I WASN'T WHEN I WAS YOUNGER AND THEN GOT TOO CLOSE TO IT. IT'S A GOOD LESSON THAT MAKES ONE MORE APPRECIATIVE LATER. <br />
<br />
<b>WHAT ARE YOU BELIEVING IN?</b> <br />
<br />
REASON AND ORDER. <br />
<br />
<b>YOUR GIRLFRIEND, MICHELE LAMY, PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE FOR YOUR LIFE AND WORK. CAN YOU DESCRIBE YOUR RELATIONSHIP?</b> <br />
<br />
SHE REMINDS ME TO BE HUMAN. SHE'S ALL INTUITION WHERE I'M TOO PRACTICAL. SHE'S THE INCENSE AND VEILS BEHIND MY CONCRETE WALLS. <br />
<br />
<b>HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH THE FRENCH MENTALITY?</b> <br />
<br />
I DON'T REALLY PERSONALLY ENGAGE WITH FRANCE. I'M JUST A VISITOR. <br />
<br />
<b>DO YOU FEEL DESIRE FOR LOS ANGELES SOMETIMES?</b> <br />
<br />
NOT REALLY. I'M NOT VERY SENTIMENTAL, AND THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER BEACHES TO VISIT. <br />
<br />
<b>CAN YOU IMAGINE RETURNING ONE DAY?</b> <br />
<br />
ONE DAY MY PARENTS WILL BE TOO TIRED TO VISIT. <br />
<br />
<b>AND THE FINAL QUESTION: WHO WILL BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE USA?</b> <br />
<br />
