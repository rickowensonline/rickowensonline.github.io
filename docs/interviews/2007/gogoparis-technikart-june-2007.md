# GOGOPARIS/TECHNIKART – JUNE 2007
## JUNE 2007

<br><br></p>
<p>I LOVE THE VIRGIN MEGASTORE ON THE CHAMPS ELYSEES. IT'S IN A BEAUX ARTS BUILDING WITH A GRAND STAIRCASE THAT GIVES THE WHOLE CONSUMER ORGY SOME DIGNITY AND DRAMA. <br />
<br />
I LIKE TO GO SEE MOVIES AT LA PAGODE IN THE 7TH ARRONDISSEMENT. IT USED TO BE A PRIVATE TEAHOUSE WITH EMBROIDERED PANELING INSIDE THE THEATRE THAT WAS PROTECTED BY CHAIN LINK DURING RECENT REFURBISHING. LOVED IT LIKE THAT. <br />
<br />
BEHIND THE MUSEE DES ARTS DECORATIFS, THERE'S A RESTAURANT THAT JOINS THE JARDIN DES TUILERIES (LE SAUT DU LOUP). IT'S RIGHT NEXT TO THE BUSHES THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN THE GAY CRUISE CORNER OF THE JARDIN. VERY HANDY. <br />
<br />
I LOVE EVERY LADUREE. I THINK THERE'S THREE OF THEM. BESIDES PERFECT VANILLA MACARONS IN BEAUTIFUL BOXES, YOU CAN GET THEIR CANDLES IN SCENTS LIKE BRIOCHE THAT ARE AMAZINGLY ACCURATE. <br />
<br />
BEST GALLERIES FOR FURNITURE ARE JOUSSE FOR 20TH CENTURY LIKE PROUVE, PERRIAND, ETC., AND ERIC DE SOMETHING FOR A BEAUTIFULLY EDITED SELECTION OF VINTAGE SWEDISH AND FRENCH STUFF. <br />
<br />
THE NEW CURATOR AT PALAIS DE TOKYO SEEMS FRESH. MY FAVORITE BUILDING IN PARIS. <br />
