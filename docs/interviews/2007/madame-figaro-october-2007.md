# MADAME FIGARO – OCTOBER 2007
## OCTOBER 2007

<br><br></p>
<p>I USED TO WEAR A LOT OF JEWELRY. I HAD A BLACK ROSARY HANGING FROM MY NOSE RING TO MY EAR AND A LOT OF METAL BRACELETS THAT I WORE WITH BLACK LEATHER GLOVES. AS I GOT OLDER, I WAS ABLE TO CONCENTRATE ON EXPRESSING MYSELF IN OTHER WAYS AND IGNORE MYSELF PERSONALLY. I BECAME A CONDUCTOR THAT THAT ENERGY WENT THROUGH. <br />
<br />
THAT BEING SAID, I NEVER CREATED MICHELE. SHE'S A POWERFUL FORCE OF NATURE THAT I JUST OFFER SACRIFICES TO SO SHE WON'T HURT ME. I WOULD NEVER PRESUME TO SELECT OR ARRANGE ANY OF HER JEWELRY, BUT SOMETIMES I'M THERE FOR THE MOMENT OF DISCOVERY WHEN SHE FINDS SOMETHING THAT MUST BELONG TO HER. <br />
<br />
SHE WAS ALWAYS IN LOVE WITH THAT GUY WITH THE GOLD FRONT TEETH FROM 'BELLE DE JOUR,' AND THEN SNOOP DOGG. SO OF COURSE SHE HAD HER FRONT TEETH DONE AS SOON AS SHE HAD THE EXCUSE. <br />
<br />
SO I SUPPOSE THOSE TEETH WOULD BE THE CLOSEST THING I HAVE TO A PERSONAL AMULET. I LOOK AT THEM EVERY DAY, WHEN I MIGHT NOT NOTICE A RING OR TWO MISSING. AND I'M DEFINITELY SENTIMENTALLY ATTACHED TO ITS SETTING. <br />
