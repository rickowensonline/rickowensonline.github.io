# NET-A-PORTER – MAY 2007
## MAY 2007

<br><br></p>
<p><b>WHAT ARE YOUR INSPIRATIONS FOR THIS COLLECTION?</b> <br />
<br />
I STUCK WITH THE SAME SOBER AND DISCREET COLORS I ALWAYS DO, BUT AMPLIFIED THE VOLUME AND INSULATION FACTOR. QUILTED ELEMENTS ADDED STRUCTURE WITH EVERYTHING JUST HANGING FROM THAT. JERSEY'S GREAT BECAUSE IT CAN CREATE SUCH A FORGIVING, LONG, VERTICAL LINE. <br />
<br />
<b>WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE LOOK?</b> <br />
<br />
I HAVE TO ADMIT I ALWAYS LIKE A HEAD WRAPPED IN A STRUCTURED COLLAR LIKE A GIFT IN TISSUE PAPER. <br />
<br />
<b>WHO ARE THE CELEBRITY FANS OF THE LABEL?</b> <br />
<br />
JUST SHIPPED TO MADONNA AND KEITH RICHARDS TODAY. <br />
<br />
<b>WHICH OTHER LABELS WOULD YOU PLACE YOUR LABEL BESIDES?</b> <br />
