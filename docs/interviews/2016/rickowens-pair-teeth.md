# WWW.THELOVEMAGAZINE.CO.UK —A PAIR OF TEETH (APERITIF) : WITH RICK OWENS (QUEEN CUNTESSABELL) — AUGUST 22 2016 — MONICA URQUIJO
## AUGUST 22 2016 

<br><br>
THE PROCLAIMED 'PRINCE OF DARKNESS' IS ALWAYS CHALLENGING THE BOUNDARIES OF FASHION. RICK OWENS NEVER CEASES TO AMUSE SPECTATORS AT HIS FASHION SHOWS; FROM WOMEN HANGING ON EACH OTHER, TO MEN WITH THEIR PENISES OUT, RICK ALWAYS ENTERTAINS. HE'S WON THE CFDA NEW TALENT AWARD, HAS A FURNITURE LINE UNDER HIS BELT, AND CONTINUES TO EXECUTE THE TRUE MEANING OF 'GLUNGE' (GLAMOUR-MEETS-GRUNGE).
