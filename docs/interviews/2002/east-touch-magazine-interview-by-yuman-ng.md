# EAST TOUCH MAGAZINE – INTERVIEW BY YUMAN NG - MARCH 2002
## MARCH 2002

<br><br></p>
<p><b>THE FIRST RICK OWENS STORE HAS OPENED IN HONG KONG. HOW DO YOU FEEL?</b> <br />
<br />
I THINK OF THE SONG 'NESSUN DORMA' FROM THE OPERA 'TURANDOT.' A NOT ALTOGETHER ACCURATE FANTASY OF CHINA, BUT I LOVE FANTASY, DON'T YOU? IT'S A SONG OF SUCH ACHING LONGING, TENDERNESS AND DETERMINATION THAT EXPRESSES EVERYTHING I'VE EVER WANTED TO SAY, AND DESCRIBES EMOTIONS THAT EVERYONE CAN RELATE TO, NO MATTER WHERE THEY'RE FROM. <br />
<br />
<b>WHAT IS THE INTERIOR DESIGN CONCEPT OF THE STORE?</b> <br />
<br />
I WANT ALL OF MY STORES TO LOOK LIKE A LEATHER BAR DESIGNED BY EILEEN GREY. <br />
<br />
<b>WHAT IS FASHION?</b> <br />
<br />
AN ENJOYABLE AND FUNDAMENTAL WAY FOR PEOPLE TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES AND DISCRETELY COMMUNICATE. <br />
<br />
<b>WHAT IS YOUR DESIGN PHILOSOPHY?</b> <br />
<br />
I'M TRYING TO CREATE A SIMPLE, GRACEFUL LINE FROM POINT A TO POINT B. <br />
<br />
<b>CAN YOU DESCRIBE YOURSELF IN 3 WORDS?</b> <br />
<br />
SELF-FORGIVING MONSTER. <br />
<br />
<b>WHAT IS YOUR MUSE / INSPIRATIONS OF YOUR DESIGN?</b> <br />
<br />
CONTRAST. THE INDECISION BETWEEN COLLAPSE AND CONTROL, BRUTALITY AND REFINEMENT, GRACE AND UGLINESS. <br />
<br />
<b>WHAT IS THE MEANING OF YOUR COLOR SCHEME, WHICH IS MAINLY BLACK, WHITE AND GREY ?</b> <br />
<br />
I PREFER TO SPEAK WITH TEXTURES AND SILHOUETTES. ADDING COLOR WOULD BE TOO MUCH INFORMATION. <br />
<br />
<b>CAN YOU DESCRIBE YOUR DESIGN AESTHETIC?</b> <br />
<br />
BROKEN IDEALISM. <br />
<br />
<b>WHICH COLLECTION IS YOUR BEST?</b> <br />
<br />
I HAVE VERY FOND MEMORIES OF S/S 2009: THE PACE, THE MUSIC AND SEVERITY OF THE CLOTHES ALL CAME TOGETHER PERFECTLY FOR ME. <br />
<br />
<b>CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR FIRST JOB?</b> <br />
<br />
MY FIRST JOB EVER? I WORKED AS A SALESPERSON IN A CHILDREN'S CLOTHING STORE IN PORTERVILLE, THE VERY SMALL TOWN IN CALIFORNIA THAT I WAS RAISED IN. <br />
<br />
<b>WHAT DO YOU BELIEVE IN?</b> <br />
<br />
DISCIPLINE. <br />
<br />
<b>FOR YOU, WHAT IS LIFE?</b> <br />
<br />
MOMENTUM. <br />
<br />
<b>WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS WORLD?</b> <br />
<br />
I THINK IT WAS MARVELOUS LONG BEFORE WE ARRIVED AND WILL BE MARVELOUS LONG AFTER WE ARE GONE. <br />
<br />
<b>YOUR FAVORITE FOODS, MOVIES, MOVIE DIRECTOR, MUSIC/SONG AND BOOKS?</b> <br />
<br />

<br />
<b>WHO ARE YOUR MALE ICONS?</b> <br />
<br />
LIBERACE, NEIL YOUNG, GARY COOPER, IGGY POP, HELMUT BERGER, DIVINE. <br />
<br />
<b>AND THE FEMALE ICONS?</b> <br />
<br />
CHARLOTTE RAMPLING, EDITH SITWELL, VANESSA REDGRAVE, AUDREY HEPBURN, DIVINE. <br />
<br />
<b>WHO IS YOUR FAVORITE FASHION DESIGNER? AND WHY?</b> <br />
<br />
VIONNET. HER SIMPLICITY, MODESTY AND ELEGANCE SEEM APPROPRIATE AND RATIONAL, EVEN NOW. <br />
<br />
<b>WHAT DO YOU HAVE FAITH IN?</b> <br />
<br />
RESILIENCE. <br />
<br />
<b>WHAT THINGS DO YOU HATE?</b> <br />
<br />
I TRY NOT TO HATE. <br />
<br />
<b>WHAT ARE THE THINGS YOU LOVE?</b> <br />
<br />
THE LIST IS ENDLESS. <br />
<br />
<b>WHERE WOULD YOU LIKE TO TRAVEL?</b> <br />
<br />
I HAVE YET TO GO TO CHINA AND INDIA. <br />
<br />
<b>DO YOU HAVE ANY TATTOO? WHAT DO THEY MEAN?</b> <br />
<br />
I HAVE 20-YEAR-OLD TATTOOS THAT, AT THE TIME, MEANT DEFIANCE, AGGRESSION AND ABANDON. THAT PERIOD OF MY LIFE HAS PASSED, BUT I LOOK AT THEM NOW WITH AFFECTIONATE MEMORIES. <br />
<br />
<b>WHAT IS YOUR DREAM WORLD?</b> <br />
<br />
VICES THAT I'VE GIVEN UP. <br />
<br />
<b>WHAT IS YOUR HOBBY?</b> <br />
<br />
WORK, OF COURSE. <br />
<br />
<b>WHAT DO YOU NORMALLY DO ON THE WEEKEND?</b> <br />
<br />
HAVE TIME TO CREATE. <br />
<br />
<b>WHAT IS YOUR FASHION MOMENT?</b> <br />
<br />
GOING INTO ONE OF MY STORES AND SEEING A SUMMARIZATION OF EVERYTHING I'VE DONE CAN SOMETIMES BE VERY SATISFYING. <br />
<br />
<b>HAVE YOU EVER WORN A SUIT?</b> <br />
<br />
SURE, WHEN I WAS A KID. <br />
<br />
<b>WHY ARE COLLARED MEN'S SHIRTS NOT IN YOUR COLLECTIONS?</b> <br />
<br />
THEY ARE JUST NOT SOMETHING THAT INTERESTS ME. AND I DON'T FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO PLEASE EVERYONE. <br />
<br />
<b>WHAT IS THE BEST PARTY YOU HAVE BEEN TO?</b> <br />
<br />
I'M NOT MUCH OF A PARTY PERSON, BUT I LOVE BEING ON A DANCE FLOOR IN THE EARLY MORNING IN A HAZE OF FOG WHEN THE MUSIC GETS INTENSE. <br />
<br />
<b>CAN YOU SHOW SOME YOUR HAND DRAWINGS TO HONG KONG FANS?</b> <br />
<br />
I DON'T REALLY DRAW. I WORK WITH THE FABRIC AND PATTERNS AND MAKE NOTES ON COMPUTER IMAGES. <br />
<br />
<b>HOW MANY PAIRS OF SHOES YOU HAVE?</b> <br />
<br />
PERSONALLY? ONLY ONE PAIR AT A TIME. I USUALLY CHANGE EVERY 3 MONTHS. <br />
<br />
<b>IN 10 YEARS, RICK OWENS WILL...?</b> <br />
<br />
...BE LIVING ON HIS VINTAGE BATTLESHIP BETWEEN CORSICA AND EGYPT. <br />
<br />
<b>WHAT IS YOUR NEXT PROJECT IN ASIA?</b> <br />
<br />
NO IDEA YET. <br />
<br />
<b>HAVE YOU COME HONG KONG BEFORE? OR WILL YOU?</b> <br />
<br />
