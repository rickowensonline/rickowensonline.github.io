# DAZED & CONFUSED JAPAN - MARCH 2002
## MARCH 2002

<br><br></p>
<p><b>WHAT IS THE CONCEPT/INSPIRATION SOURCE FOR THIS ART VISUAL?</b> <br />
<br />
I'VE BEEN WORKING IN MY HOUSE WITH CONCRETE AND MAKING CAST CONCRETE LAMPS. CONCRETE IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE MATERIALS TO WORK WITH. IT SUGGESTS IMMOVABILITY, BLUNTNESS AND SILENCE. IT'S MY REACTION TO EXCESSIVE HYPERBOLIC INFORMATION. I WORKED WITH MY AMULETS AND FETISHES: HAIR, ANTLERS AND CRYSTALS. I DON'T BELIEVE IN THEM, OR IN ANYTHING, REALLY. I JUST LIKE THE CEREMONY AND SUPERSTITION ATTACHED TO THEM. A NEED FOR FAITH. <br />
<br />
<b>DO YOU READ ART BOOKS? IF SO, ARE YOU INSPIRED BY THEM?</b> <br />
