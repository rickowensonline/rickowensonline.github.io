# INTERSECTION - MARCH 2002
## MARCH 2002

<br><br></p>
<p>I HAVEN'T DRIVEN A CAR FOR 5 YEARS. IN L.A., WHERE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO GET ANYWHERE WITHOUT A CAR, I RENTED A BLACK LINCOLN TOWN CAR AND CHANGED IT EVERY MONTH. BEFORE THAT, I HAD A BLACK T-TOP V8 CAMARO. I'LL ALWAYS REMEMBER THE GLORY OF SPEEDING DOWN THE FREEWAY IN THAT CAR, THE TOP OFF, IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, AND CRESTING THE MOUNTAINS AND SEEING THE LIGHTS OF L.A. I HAD KISS BLASTING ON THE STEREO, A BOTTLE OF VODKA BETWEEN MY LEGS, AND I WAS IMMORTAL. THAT WAS A LONG, LONG TIME AGO. <br />
<br />
IN PARIS, EVERY PLACE I NEED TO GET TO IS A CLOSE METRO RIDE OR WALK. GROWING UP IN CALIFORNIA WITHOUT SUBWAYS, THE METRO HOLDS GREAT URBAN NOVELTY FOR ME. BUT WHEN I NEED TO GET SOMEWHERE, I USE A DRIVER, USUALLY KEVIN OR GUY. <br />
<br />
WHEN I'M TRAVELING, I DEFINITELY HIRE A DRIVER SO I CAN SEE THE MOST THE FASTEST. <br />
