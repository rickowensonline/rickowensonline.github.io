# DUJOUR MAGAZINE - MARCH 2002
## MARCH 2002

<br><br></p>
<p><b>WHAT WAS YOUR INSPIRATION FOR THE WOMEN'S SPRING/SUMMER 2009 COLLECTION?</b> <br />
<br />
I WAS THINKING OF A CRISP MODERNIST VERSION OF HEALTH AND DISCIPLINE. I KIND OF GLIBLY MENTIONED 'PRIESTESSES OF LONGING.' I'D KNOWN THIS KIND OF QUESTION WAS COMING AND I'D THOUGHT 'WELL, SOMEONES GONNA ASK. WHAT IS IT I'M TRYING TO EXPRESS?' AND I WOKE UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WITH THE WORD 'LONGING.' IT'S THE ROOT OF EVERY OPERA, EVERY POP SONG, EVERY RELIGION, EVERY ADVERTISEMENT. LONGING FOR LOVE, LONGING FOR A HIGH, LONGING FOR VALIDATION. AND WHAT IF LONGING WAS ELIMINATED? MIGHT THAT NOT JUST LEAVE A DISCIPLINED FUNCTIONALITY? THAT KIND OF IDEA APPEALED TO ME. LONGINGS, URGES AND POSSESSIVENESS IS SOMETHING I'D GRADUALLY BEEN WANTING TO RETREAT FROM AS I GOT OLDER. I DON'T KNOW IF I HAVE, OR IF I'M KIDDING MYSELF. PROBABLY BOTH. BUT DOESN'T 'PRIESTESSES OF LONGING' SOUND PRETTY? <br />
<br />
<b>YOU ALSO DESIGN A MEN'S LINE; LILIES (A JERSEY COLLECTION FOR WOMEN); DRKSHDW (A DENIM COLLECTION FOR MEN AND WOMEN); AND FURNITURE. DO YOU USE THE SAME INSPIRATIONS AND REFERENCES FOR ALL YOUR COLLECTIONS?</b> <br />
<br />
YES, I DO. I'M SOMEWHAT OF A PRAGMATIST. I DON'T REALLY DO FANTASIES. MAYBE I SHOULD. <br />
<br />
<b>OUT OF THE 5 COLLECTIONS YOU DESIGN, WHICH DO YOU FIND THE MOST CHALLENGING?</b> <br />
<br />
DENIM. I NEVER WEAR JEANS ANYMORE. THEY'RE JUST TOO STIFF AND UPTIGHT. HOW DOES SOMEONE DO SOMETHING MODERN WITH SOMETHING SO PROSAIC AND NORMAL? BUT DON'T GET ME WRONG, I DO ENJOY THE CHALLENGE. PERSONALLY, I JUST WEAR SWEATPANTS AND SHORTS SO I DON'T HAVE TO CHANGE FOR THE GYM EVERY DAY. I LIKE WEARING A UNIFORM. LIKE ALAIA. OR HITLER. OR A PRIEST. <br />
<br />
<b>YOU'VE RECENTLY OPENED STORES IN NEW YORK CITY AND LONDON. I WOULD IMAGINE THE PROCESS OF FINDING THE RIGHT SPACE WOULD BE VERY STRENUOUS. WHAT DO YOU LOOK FOR WHEN SEARCHING FOR THE RIGHT SPOT?</b> <br />
<br />
SURPRISINGLY, ALL THE STORES JUST FELL FROM THE SKY. I NEVER LOOKED FOR THEM OR PLANNED FOR THEM. BUT AFTER THE SUCCESS OF THE FIRST ONE, I GUESS MORE JUST SEEMED LIKE A GOOD IDEA. IT'S GOTTA HAVE GOOD BONES AND BE DISCREET BUT NOT BE TOO FAR AWAY FOR SHOPPERS TO WALK TO. I'M QUIET BUT I'M NOT AN IDIOT. <br />
<br />
<b>FUTURE PLANS TO OPEN MORE STORES? WHICH CITIES?</b> <br />
<br />
SEOUL IS NEXT. <br />
<br />
<b>YOU MOVED FROM LOS ANGELES TO PARIS IN 2003. WHY? </b><br />
<br />
IT WAS JUST TOO LONG A SCHLEP FROM L.A. TO ITALY, WHERE I'D STARTED MANUFACTURING AT THE TIME. IT WASN'T THAT BIG OF A DEAL TO MOVE. <br />
<br />
<b>WHAT DO YOU MISS THE MOST ABOUT L.A.?</b> <br />
<br />
SUNNY WINTER MORNINGS. <br />
<br />
<b>LEAST?</b> <br />
<br />
DRIVING. <br />
<br />
<b>BEST RESTAURANT IN PARIS?</b> <br />
<br />
NO CLUE. <br />
<br />
<b>SHOP?</b> <br />
<br />
MINE. GO BUY SOMETHING. <br />
<br />
<b>CLUB?</b> <br />
<br />
DON'T GO. <br />
<br />
<b>DO YOU GO OUT MUCH?</b> <br />
<br />
RARELY. THE MAIN REASONS FOR TO GO OUT WERE TO GET LAID, WASTED OR NOTICED. I DON'T DO ANY OF THOSE ANYMORE BUT I DO DANCE. DANCING IS ONE OF THE SIMPLEST AND PUREST ACTS OF JOY THAT THERE IS. IF I GO OUT, IT'S TO SOMEPLACE BLACK, AFTERHOURS, WITH AN ARMY OF MEN FOCUSED ON THE MUSIC. <br />
<br />
<b>YOU RARELY ATTEND ANY SHOWS BUT YOU WERE RECENTLY SPOTTED AT GARETH PUGH'S SPRING/SUMMER 09 SHOW IN PARIS. HOW WAS IT?</b> <br />
<br />
IT WAS WONDERFUL. FOCUSED AND EDITED. <br />
<br />
<b>WHICH OTHER DESIGNERS DO YOU ENJOY?</b> <br />
<br />
I'M A BIG FASHION FAN OF A LOT OF DESIGNERS. <br />
<br />
<b>DO YOU READ FASHION MAGAZINES?</b> <br />
<br />
SURE. ON THE PLANE. <br />
<br />
<b>WATCH TV?</b> <br />
<br />
NO. I'LL WATCH ABOUT 15 MINUTES OF SOME OLD MOVIE ON TCM EVERY NIGHT AND FALL ASLEEP. <br />
<br />
<b>WHAT IS CURRENTLY IN ROTATION ON YOUR IPOD? CD PLAYER? RECORD PLAYER? COMPUTER?</b> <br />
<br />
JOEY BELTRAM, AUTECHRE, LABELLE, KISS AND ALWAYS MONTSERRAT CABALLE. <br />
<br />
<b>YOU HAVE ACCOMPLISHED SO MUCH IN LESS THAN A DECADE. WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO ACHIEVE NEXT?</b> <br />
<br />
