# L'UOMO VOGUE – BY GIANLUCA CANTARO - MARCH 2002
## MARCH 2002

<br><br></p>
<p><b>WHO IS YOUR EASTPAK COLLECTION FOR?</b> <br />
<br />
I WOULDN'T PRESUME TO DESCRIBE MY CUSTOMER. I'M JUST PROPOSING MY PERSONAL CHOICE. SOMETHING AUSTERE, A LITTLE INSTITUTIONAL, WITH A PAST. <br />
<br />
<b>CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHERE THE COLLECTION CAME FROM; YOUR THOUGHTS AND THE INSPIRATION BEHIND IT?</b> <br />
<br />
I KNEW EASTPAK ORIGINALLY FROM THE ARMY SURPLUS STORE ON HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD, DOWN THE STREET FROM WHERE I LIVED IN MY YOUNGER DAYS. THIS IS WHERE THE KIDS ON THE STREETS WOULD GET THEIR USED ARMY CLOTHES THAT THEY OVERDYED BLACK AND DECORATED WITH THE METAL ENDS OF USED LIGHTERS. THEY ALWAYS HAD SOME KIND OF EASTPAK DUFFLE THAT WAS SO OLD AND USED THAT YOU COULD BARELY SEE THE LOGO. BUT IT WAS THERE. <br />
<br />
<b>HOW DO YOU THINK A WIDER RANGE OF CUSTOMERS WILL RESPOND TO YOUR VERY OWN STYLE?</b> <br />
<br />
I HAVE NO CLUE HOW A WIDER RANGE OF CUSTOMERS WILL RESPOND TO MY STYLE. I'M SURPRISED ANYBODY DOES AT ALL. <br />
<br />
<b>HAS YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH EASTPAK BEEN A TECHNOLOGIC CHALLENGE? DID YOU TEST ANY NEW MATERIAL AND DESIGN?</b> <br />
<br />
