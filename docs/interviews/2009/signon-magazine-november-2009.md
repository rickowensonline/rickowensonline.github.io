# SIGNON MAGAZINE – NOVEMBER 2009
## NOVEMBER 2009

<br><br></p>
<p><b>AS A DESIGNER WHOSE COLLECTIONS SOMETIME EVOKE GOTH MOTIFS, WHAT IS YOUR ATTRACTION TO THE VAMPIRE AESTHETIC AND DARK GLAMOUR?</b> <br />
<br />
IT'S AN ADOLESCENT ATTRACTION TO TRANSGRESSION. I LIKE THE IDEA OF LETTING THE ID WIN. <br />
<br />
<b>YOU HAVE SAID IN PAST INTERVIEW THAT 'ITS ALL ABOUT DEATH AND DRAMA' FOR YOU. CAN YOU EXPLAIN?</b> <br />
<br />
MOMENTS OF EMOTION AND PASSION ARE WHAT WE REMEMBER ON OUR DEATHBED. THAT KIND OF SUMMARIZES A LIFE. I REALIZE THAT THIS IS A CRUDE CARTOON, BUT I LIKE LOOKING AT THINGS WITHIN THE SCALE OF THAT FRAMEWORK. <br />
<br />
<b>WHY, IN YOUR OPINION, HAS THE FLIRTATION WITH THE DARK SIDE BECOME A TREND IN POPULAR CULTURE?</b> <br />
<br />
BEAUTY + DANGER = EXCITEMENT. TAKEN ONE STEP FURTHER, SEX + DEATH = EXCITEMENT. I THINK THAT WITH THE OVERSATURATION OF INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO US NOW VIA THE INTERNET, THE WORLD MAYBE FEELS MORE COMFORTABLE IN INDULGING IN FUNDAMENTAL URGES. <br />
<br />
<b>WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE VAMPIRE MOVIE?</b> <br />
<br />
ANDY WARHOL'S 'DRACULA.' <br />
<br />
<b>THE VAMPIRE HAS BEEN CALLED 'THE NEW JAMES DEAN.' WHAT DO YOU THINK?</b> <br />
<br />
