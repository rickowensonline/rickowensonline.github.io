# L.A. TIMES – SEPTEMBER 2009 – RICK OWENS DELVES INTO FURNITURE DESIGN – BY WHITNEY FRIEDLANDER
## SEPTEMBER 2009

<br><br></p>
<p><b>WHEN DID YOU BECOME INTERESTED IN FURNITURE?</b> <br />
<br />
I HAD FURNITURE MADE FOR MY HOUSE IN PARIS BECAUSE I COULDN'T AFFORD ALL THE EMILE-JACQUES RUHLMANN AND PIERRE CHAREAU FURNITURE I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO FURNISH IT WITH. AND BESIDES, ALL THAT STUFF IS TOO SMALL. I SHOWED IT AS A FURNITURE COLLECTION ON A WHIM AND IT DEVELOPED A LIFE OF ITS OWN. <br />
<br />
<b>HOW DOES THE COLLECTION COMPLEMENT YOUR CLOTHING LINE?</b> <br />
<br />
I SCOTCH-TAPED DECO/BAUHAUS OUT OF BLACK PLYWOOD AND FUR JUST LIKE I SCOTCH-TAPED VIONNET OUT OF OLD T-SHIRTS AND WASHED LEATHER. <br />
<br />
<b>DO YOU PLANS TO CONTINUE IT AND POSSIBLY EVEN EXPAND UPON IT?</b> <br />
<br />
