# NK – NOVEMBER 2009
##  NOVEMBER 2009

<br><br></p>
<p><b>WHY DID YOU CHOOSE TO EXPAND INTO HOME DESIGN? WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES AND ADVANTAGES, COMPARED TO CLOTHES?</b> <br />
<br />
I CAN ONLY THINK OF ADVANTAGES. WHAT BIGGER LUXURY CAN THERE BE THAN TO CUSTOMIZE EVERYTHING AROUND YOU THAT YOU USE EVERY DAY? WHEN I FIRST BOUGHT MY HOUSE I NEEDED TO FURNISH IT, AND FURNISHING IT ALL IN RUHLMANN AND MOLLINO AND EILEEN GREY WOULD HAVE COST MORE THAN THREE HOUSES, SO I FAKED IT BY SCOTCH-TAPING MY FAVORITE INSPIRATIONS TOGETHER JUST LIKE I DID WITH MY FIRST SMALL COLLECTION—WHICH I SELL EVERY SEASON TO THIS DAY. <br />
<br />
<b>DESCRIBE THE VISION AND AESTHETIC OF YOUR FURNITURE. WALLPAPER MAGAZINE CALLED YOUR COLLECTION 'FUNCTIONAL POETRY.' DO YOU AGREE?</b> <br />
<br />
FUNCTIONAL POETRY IS A LOT TO LIVE UP TO. I WOULD ENJOY THINKING THAT. JUST LIKE THE CLOTHES, I'M THINKING OF IDEALISM, DEFEAT AND DISCIPLINE. IN THAT ORDER. I ALWAYS SAY THAT MY CLOTHES ARE MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY, AND THIS APPLIES TO THE FURNITURE AS WELL. <br />
<br />
<b>THE SPRING 2010 COLLECTION AND ITS INSPIRATION?</b> <br />
<br />
I LIKED THE IDEAS OF FUNCTIONAL EXOTICISM AND OPULENCE. NOT DRAG QUEENY, BUT REAL. <br />
<br />
<b>HOW WOULD YOU LIKE PEOPLE TO APPROACH THEIR CLOTHES AND INTERIOR DESIGN THIS SPRING?</b> <br />
