# VOGUE JAPAN – NOVEMBER 2009 – FASHION CAREER BIBLE
## NOVEMBER 2009

<br><br></p>
<p><b>HOW CAN I BECOME A FASHION DESIGNER? WHAT SHOULD WE START TO BEGIN WITH? (21 YEARS OLD, MALE)</b> <br />
<br />
I SUGGEST LEARNING HOW TO MAKE CLOTHES. <br />
<br />
<b>WHAT SHOULD I WEAR WHEN I GO FOR A JOB INTERVIEW? IS IT NOT GOOD TO WEAR MY FAVORITE OUTFIT THAN SOMETHING THAT SUITS THE BRAND IMAGE OF THE COMPANY I AM APPLYING TO? (19 YEARS OLD, MALE)</b> <br />
<br />
AS AN EMPLOYER, I'D LIKE TO SEE WHAT YOUR PERSONAL STYLE IS. IT'S GOING TO BE REVEALED AT SOME POINT ANYWAY, SO THE SOONER THE BETTER FOR BOTH OF US. <br />
<br />
<b>MANY DESIGNERS ARE FROM A GOOD FAMILY. BUT I AM NOT RICH NOR A CITY-DWELLER, AND IT IS HARD TO GET A GOOD EDUCATION. HOW CAN I BREAK THROUGH THE CIRCUMSTANCES TO BE A DESIGNER? (20 YEARS OLD, FEMALE)</b> <br />
<br />
IT NEVER OCCURRED TO ME TO SEE THAT AS A DETRIMENT. IF YOU ALREADY HAVE THAT ATTITUDE, MAYBE IT ISN'T FOR YOU. <br />
<br />
<b>HOW CAN I GET A JOB OR BECOME AN INTERN FOR INTERNATIONAL FASHION BRANDS? IS THERE ANY QUALIFICATION I SHOULD HAVE? (18 YEARS OLD, MALE)</b> <br />
<br />
QUIET EFFICIENCY. <br />
<br />
<b>COULD YOU GIVE ALL THE STUDENTS WHO WANT TO WORK IN FASHION INDUSTRY ANY ADVICE? (24 YEARS OLD, FEMALE)</b> <br />
<br />
