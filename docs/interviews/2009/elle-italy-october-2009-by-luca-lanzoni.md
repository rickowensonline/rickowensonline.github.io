# ELLE ITALY – OCTOBER 2009 – BY LUCA LANZONI
## OCTOBER 2009

<br><br></p>
<p><b>TELL US ABOUT THE ACCESSORIES LINE THAT YOU HAVE DESIGNED FOR EASTPAK. THE INFLUENCES, THE FABRICS. DO YOU HAVE ANY FAVOURITE PIECES IN THE COLLECTION?</b> <br />
<br />
I LIKE THE BUCKET BAG FOR ITS EASE AND REDUCTIVENESS. PERFECT FOR CARRYING A KILO OF MAGAZINES ON A PLANE. <br />
<br />
<b>WHAT ARE THE ESSENTIAL PIECES IN A MAN'S WARDROBE? AND IN YOUR STYLE?</b> <br />
<br />
I THINK A BLACK TRENCH WITH A SHARP SHOULDER, A BLACK LOOSE CASHMERE TURTLENECK, BLACK POPLIN TRACK PANTS, MY BLACK TRAINERS AND A BLACK NYLON EASTPACK/DRKSHDW BUCKET BAG CAN PRETTY MUCH TAKE ANY GUY ANYWHERE. AT WORST, YOU MIGHT BE MISTAKEN FOR AN ARCHITECT. <br />
<br />
<b>THREE WORDS TO DESCRIBE YOUR STYLE.</b> <br />
<br />
PERSONAL STYLE? ASCETIC, CLINICAL, FUNCTIONAL. STYLE I PROPOSE IN MY COLLECTIONS? SOFT, GREY, FLUID. <br />
<br />
<b>YOUR INSPIRATIONS? MUSIC, ART.</b> <br />
<br />
MONTSERRAT CABALLE EVERY DAY REMINDS ME ABOUT WHAT DISCIPLINED PERFECTION IS. LE CORBUSIER EVERY DAY REMINDS ME ABOUT RATIONALISM WITH A LIGHT TOUCH. BRANCUSI EVERY DAY REMINDS ME ABOUT CONSISTENCY AND PACE. <br />
<br />
<b>GROWING UP, WHAT OR WHO WERE YOUR BIGGEST FASHION INFLUENCES? THE IMPORTANCE ABOUT THE STREET AND ROCK CULTURE IN YOUR WORK?</b> <br />
<br />
FAVORITE STYLE MOMENTS WERE BOWIE'S 'DIAMOND DOGS' COVER, DIVINE'S SHAVED EYEBROWS AND HAIRLINE IN 'PINK FLAMINGOS,' AND CLAUDE MONTANA. <br />
<br />
<b>WHEN DID YOU DECIDE THAT YOU WANTED TO BECOME A DESIGNER?</b> <br />
<br />
AFTER I DECIDED I DIDN'T HAVE THE BALLS TO BE AN ARTIST. <br />
<br />
<b>WHAT WAS THE FIRST PIECE OF CLOTHING YOU MADE AND WHO WAS IT FOR?</b> <br />
<br />
BLACK TRASH-BAG PANTS FOR MYSELF. <br />
<br />
<b>IS THERE A PARTICULAR FASHION ERA THAT YOU THINK OFTEN ABOUT?</b> <br />
<br />
MY FAVORITE ERAS ARE THE '40S, WHEN ADRIAN AND JEAN LOUIS PERFECTED A GODDESS SILHOUETTE, AND THE '70S, WHEN LARRY LEGASPI AND RUDI GERNREICH CORRUPTED IT. <br />
<br />
<b>WHICH IS THE DESIGNER, PAST OR PRESENT, THAT YOU ADMIRE THE MOST?</b> <br />
<br />
I LOVE THEM ALL. <br />
<br />
<b>IF YOU WEREN'T IN FASHION YOU WOULD BE A...</b> <br />
<br />
GARDENER AT THE VATICAN. <br />
<br />
<b>WHAT HAS BEEN YOUR GREATEST FASHION MOMENT EVER?</b> <br />
<br />
WHEN LOU REED WORE MY CLOTHES. <br />
<br />
<b>WHAT IS THE LAST CD YOU LISTENED TO?</b> <br />
<br />
LOUDBOXER BY SPEEDY J. <br />
<br />
<b>WHICH ARE YOUR FAVORITE MOVIES ?</b> <br />
<br />
NAZIMOVA'S « SALOME »<br />
CECILE B. DEMILLE'S « CLEOPATRA »<br />
FRED ASTAIRE DANCING IN 'EASTER PARADE' --AWESOME. <br />
<br />
<b>DO YOU LIKE TO TRAVEL? IF YES, WHERE? </b><br />
