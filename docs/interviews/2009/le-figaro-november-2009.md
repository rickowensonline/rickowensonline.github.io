# LE FIGARO – NOVEMBER 2009
## NOVEMBER 2009

<br><br></p>
<p><b>WHO INFLUENCED FASHION THESE LAST TEN YEARS AND WHY? WHO WILL BE THE NEXT BIG NAMES?</b> <br />
<br />
I'M A BIG FASHION FAN AND WOULD NEVER LIST FAVORITES, BUT I DON'T THINK I WOULD COME UP WITH ANY NAMES THAT WOULD SURPRISE ANYONE. <br />
<br />
<b>THE SUCCESS OF SHOPS LIKE H&M, ESHOPPING, ETHICAL AND GREEN FASHION, FASHION FOR KIDS, FAST AND SLOW FASHION...WHICH OF THESE NEWS TRENDS HAVE CHANGED THE BUSINESS LANDSCAPE, AND WHICH ONES WILL LAST?</b> <br />
<br />
I CAN'T TAKE GREEN FASHION VERY SERIOUSLY. IF YOU REALLY WANT TO HELP, BUY FEWER CLOTHES. E-SHOPPING IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT'S ON MY MIND A LOT NOW. I WOULD NEVER SEE PROGRESS AS A THREAT, BUT I HONESTLY CAN'T FIGURE OUT THE FAIREST WAY FOR THIS TO WORK YET. <br />
<br />
<b>IN YOUR OPINION, WHICH FASHION TREND MARKED THE YEARS SINCE THE MILLENNIUM?</b> <br />
<br />
I THINK THAT AS A REACTION TO INFORMATION OVERSATURATION, A DESIRE TO EDIT MORE CAREFULLY HAS DEVELOPED. <br />
<br />
<b>BLOGS, TEENAGERS AS TASTEMAKERS...FASHION HAS CHANGED. IS IT A TRANSIENT PHENOMENON OR ARE THEY THE NEXT TRENDSETTERS?</b> <br />
<br />
