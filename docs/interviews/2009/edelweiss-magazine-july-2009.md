EDELWEISS MAGAZINE – JULY 2009</b>
<br><br></p>
<p><b>TELL ME A LITTLE MORE ABOUT THE 'SAFE CONSERVATIVE TOWN' YOU CAME FROM. I'M THINKING OF 'SONGS FOR DRELLA' BY LOU REED & JOHN CALE ON ANDY WARHOL'S LIFE: 'THERE IS ONLY ONE GOOD USE FOR A SMALL TOWN: YOU HATE IT AND YOU'LL KNOW YOU HAVE TO LEAVE.' DOES THAT APPLY?</b> <br />
<br />
TOTALLY APPLIES. I'M GRATEFUL I WAS GIVEN THAT MOTIVATION. <br />
<br />
<b>REGARDING 'MINIMALIST GOTH': I ALWAYS HAD THE FEELING THAT SOMEHOW YOUR WORK IS MORE ON THE BRIGHT AND, ER.. FUN SIDE OF DARKNESS, RATHER THAN ON ITS GLOOMY SIDE. AM I WRONG?</b> <br />
<br />
RIGHT? HOW COME NO ONE ELSE SEES THAT? <br />
<br />
THEY TAKE IT SO SERIOUSLY. <br />
<br />
<b>THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT YOU THAT CONVEYS IMAGES OF 1900S DANDYISM, '70S EXCESS AND STELLAR FUTURISM. WHAT LAYERS OF TIME DO YOU LIKE TO TURN TO?</b> <br />
<br />
LOVE THE '70S TRANSLATION OF THE '40S. MONSTER SHOES AND SHAVED EYEBROWS. <br />
<br />
<b>YOUR PERSONAL LOOK REMINDS ME OF A MIX BETWEEN IGGY POP, A PIECE OF NATIVE AMERICAN ART AND A PORTRAIT CARVED IN THE ROCK LIKE ON MT. RUSHMORE. IS THE WAY YOU CREATE YOUR OWN APPEARANCE PART OF YOUR WORK AS A DESIGNER? OR IS IT SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT? </b><br />
<br />
I CREATED MYSELF AS CLINICALLY AS I CUT MY PATTERNS. <br />
<br />
<b>HOW DO YOU FEEL IN PARIS? ALWAYS A STRANGER? ALMOST A FRENCHMAN? </b><br />
<br />
