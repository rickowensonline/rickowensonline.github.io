# MONDANITE MAGAZINE – AUGUST 2009
## AUGUST 2009

<br><br></p>
<p><b>WHAT IS YOUR DAY LIKE?</b> <br />
<br />
I WAKE UP AT 7:30, HAVE A LEISURELY COFFEE AND SHOWER WHILE I WATCH THE NEWS AND CLASSIC MOVIE CHANNEL, GO DOWNSTAIRS TO MY OFFICE, MEET WITH MY ASSISTANTS, GO TO THE GYM AT NOON, WALK HOME THROUGH THE JARDIN DES TUILERIES, HAVE LUNCH ON MY TERRACE, TAKE A NAP, GET UP AND CHECK WITH MY ASSISTANTS AND WORK BY MYSELF UNTIL 9:30 WHEN I HAVE DINNER DOWN THE STREET WITH MY BETTER HALF, COME HOME, WATCH PART OF A MOVIE IN BED AND I'M ASLEEP BY 11:30. <br />
<br />
I ENJOYED SO MANY EXCESSES IN THE PAST THAT IT MAKES A QUIET LIFE NOW VERY SATISFYING. <br />
<br />
<b>WHY DID YOU DECIDE TO MOVE YOUR STUDIO FROM LOS ANGELES TO PARIS?</b> <br />
<br />
CONVENIENCE. I HAD STARTED PRODUCING MY CLOTHES IN ITALY, AND HAVING TO GO BACK AND FORTH GOT OLD FAST. <br />
<br />
<b>WHAT IMPACT DID THE RELOCATION HAVE ON YOUR DESIGNS?</b> <br />
<br />
IT PROBABLY PUSHED ME OUT OF A COMFORT ZONE. WE ALL KNOW THAT PARIS IS THE FASHION PINNACLE. <br />
<br />
<b>HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT BEING LABELED THE LEADER OF AVANT-GARDE FASHION?</b> <br />
<br />
IT SOUNDS PLEASANT, BUT YOU MIGHT FIND SOME DEBATE IN THAT. <br />
<br />
<b>WHAT SEEMED IMPORTANT TO YOU AS A YOUNG MAN THAT SEEMS IRRELEVANT NOW?</b> <br />
<br />
THE PURSUIT OF VICE. <br />
<br />
<b>WHAT WAS THE INSPIRATION BEHIND THE FALL09 COLLECTION?</b> <br />
<br />
TECHNICALLY, WHIPPED CREAM. CONCEPTUALLY, CALM PRECISION. <br />
<br />
<b>WHAT WAS THE FIRST GARMENT YOU EVER MADE?</b> <br />
<br />
A BIAS PULL-ON SKIRT WITH A TRAIN MEANT FOR DAYWEAR. <br />
<br />
<b>WHAT MUSIC DO YOU LISTEN TO WHEN DESIGNING?</b> <br />
<br />
HARD-ASS TECHNO. <br />
<br />
<b>WHO WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE WEARING YOU CLOTHES?</b> <br />
<br />
I'M PLEASED ANYONE DOES. <br />
<br />
<b>WHAT IS IT LIKE BEING SOMEONE WHO'S 'MADE IT'?</b> <br />
<br />
A RELIEF. <br />
<br />
<b>WHAT IS NEXT FOR RICK OWENS?</b> <br />
<br />
