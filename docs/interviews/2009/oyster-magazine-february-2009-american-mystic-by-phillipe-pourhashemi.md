# OYSTER MAGAZINE – FEBRUARY 2009 – AMERICAN MYSTIC – BY PHILLIPE POURHASHEMI
## FEBRUARY 2009

OYSTER MAGAZINE – FEBRUARY 2009 – AMERICAN MYSTIC – BY PHILLIPE POURHASHEMI</b>
<br><br></p>
<p><b>THE THEME OF OUR ISSUE IS 'DISTORTION.' WHAT DOES THAT WORD EVOKE FOR YOU? CAN YOU RELATE TO IT? </b><br />
<br />
TOTALLY RELATE TO IT. TO ME IT MEANS ALTER IT, ENHANCE IT, EXAGGERATE IT, EMPHASIZE IT, CORRUPT IT, CELEBRATE IT, OWN IT. <br />
<br />
<b>YOU'RE FAMOUS FOR TWISTING CLASSICS, SUCH AS THE BIKER JACKET AND BIAS SKIRTS, GIVING THEM A NEW IDENTITY. DO YOU FEEL THAT WHAT YOU DO IS MORE TIMELESS THAN TIMELY? </b><br />
<br />
THAT'S WHAT I WAS AIMING FOR. TIME WILL TELL. <br />
<br />
<b>THE CLOTHES THAT YOU DESIGN ARE REFRESHINGLY WEARABLE AND EASY TO COMBINE. ARE YOU INSPIRED BY WHAT YOU SEE ON THE STREET OR DO YOU FEEL DISTANCED FROM IT?</b> <br />
<br />
I'M NOT ON THE STREETS THE WAY I USED TO BE, BUT I REMEMBER THE BASIC IDEAS: ANTI-CONVENTIONAL FLAMBOYANCE, EMBRACING THE GROTESQUE, FEELING IMMORTAL. AS I GOT OLDER I'D KIND OF GOTTEN IT OUT OF MY SYSTEM SO MY AESTHETIC GOT MORE RELAXED. BUT THERE REMAIN VESTIGES. <br />
<br />
<b>CAN YOU TALK ME THROUGH YOUR SPRING/SUMMER COLLECTION?</b> <br />
<br />
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IT WAS BOTH AUSTERE AND EROTIC. I WAS KIND OF THINKING 'HEALTHY, DISCIPLINED, HARD ELEGANCE.' <br />
<br />
<b>THERE WAS A FEELING OF EASE AND COMFORT IN THAT COLLECTION. DO YOU THINK SIMPLICITY IS NECESSARY IN UNCERTAIN TIMES?</b> <br />
<br />
ON THE CONTRARY, I THINK THAT DURING HARD TIMES PEOPLE ARE ONLY GOING TO BUY SOMETHING THAT TRULY ENGAGES THEM. AND IT MIGHT BE THE MOMENT FOR A FRIVOLOUS DEFIANT GESTURE. BUT I SUPPOSE ANYTIME'S A GOOD TIME FOR THAT. <br />
<br />
<b>DID RELIGION INSPIRE YOU FOR THAT LAST SHOW? SOME ELEMENTS SEEMED TO REFER TO ANCIENT EGYPT AND PRIESTS. WERE YOU ATTRACTED BY THAT KIND OF IMAGERY?</b> <br />
<br />
I DO LOVE A BIT OF MYSTICISM. I DON'T BELIEVE IN ANY BUT I'M SO ATTRACTED BY RITUAL AND DEVOTION. I RATHER GLIBLY DESCRIBED MY SHOW AS 'PRIESTESSES OF LONGING,' BUT IT SOUNDS NICE, DOESN'T IT? DICTIONARY LONGING IS SOMETHING EVERYONE CAN RELATE TO: SALOME'S LONGING FOR JOHN THE BAPTIST, GRIMLY DETERMINED HOURS AT THE GYM LONGING FOR HEALTH AND A PERFECT BODY, DRUG HIGHS LONGING FOR EUPHORIA. LONGING FOR VALIDATION. IT'S A TIMELESS, CLASSIC MOTIF. <br />
<br />
<b>THE SILHOUETTE YOU CREATED WAS BOTH SOFT AND FLUID, EVEN WHEN YOU SHOWED MORE TAILORED PIECES. WHAT FABRICS DID YOU USE TO GET THAT EFFECT?</b> <br />
<br />
ALWAYS MY GEORGETTES, CREPES AND SILK GAZARS, BUT THIS SEASON I HAD A FANTASTICALLY DRAPABLE SOFT FINISH FOR ALLIGATOR THAT I'M GONNA BE WORKING 'TIL YOU ALL GET REALLY SICK OF IT. <br />
<br />
<b>THE FOOTWEAR WAS SLIGHTLY ODD. WHAT WAS THE IDEA BEHIND IT?</b> <br />
<br />
WAS IT ODD? HAVING WEIGHT AT THE END OF THE LEG MAKES LEGS LOOK SKINNIER AND KIND OF FLOPPY, AND HAVING THAT WEIGHT DRAG JUST ADDS A NICE NOTE OF ABANDON. <br />
<br />
<b>I KNOW YOU LOVE KLAUS NOMI. HE WAS A MASTER AT DISTORTING THINGS, STARTING WITH HIS OWN VOICE. ARE THERE SOME OF HIS SONGS THAT YOU LOVE MORE THAN OTHERS?</b> <br />
<br />
I PREFER HIS STRAIGHT ARIAS TO THE POP STUFF. THE POP SONGS DATED A BIT. BUT I STILL LISTEN TO HIS 'SAMSON AND DELILAH' AND 'DIDO AND AENAES' ARIAS. TALK ABOUT LONGING! THOSE SONGS SUNG BY A MAN IN ASPIRATIONAL MAKEUP ARE DRIPPING WITH IT. <br />
<br />
<b>WHAT ARE YOU WORKING ON AT THE MOMENT? ANY EXCITING TRIPS TO LOOK FORWARD TO?</b> <br />
<br />
I'M LAUNCHING MEN'S, DENIM, WOMEN'S PRECOLLECTION AND THE FURS FOR JANUARY SALES. BUT I'LL TAKE A WEEK OFF FOR SOME DISCIPLINED HARD ELEGANT SUN IN MOROCCO FOR CHRISTMAS. <br />
<br />
<b>YOUR BUSINESS HAS GROWN SLOWLY BUT STEADILY OVER THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS. HOW DO YOU INTEND ON DEVELOPING IT?</b> <br />
<br />
