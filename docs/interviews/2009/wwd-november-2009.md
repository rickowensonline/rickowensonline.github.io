# WWD – NOVEMBER 2009
## NOVEMBER 2009

<br><br></p>
<p><b>DO HOODS DEFINE A DECADE OR A MOMENT IN FASHION?</b> <br />
<br />
THEY MIGHT BE DEFINING THIS ONE. I DOUBT WE'VE EVER SEEN AS MANY HOODS AS NOW. <br />
<br />
<b>WHAT DO YOU LOVES BEST ABOUT A HOODIE?</b> <br />
<br />
I LIKE THE SIMPLICITY AND UNIVERSAL APPLICATION. CHRIST WORE A HOOD. THE UNABOMBER WORE A HOOD. GRACE JONES WORE A HOOD. DANTE WORE A HOOD. <br />
<br />
<b>IS IT A STAPLE IN YOUR OWN WARDROBE?</b> <br />
<br />
I ONLY WEAR KNIT CAPS. MY HAIR IS MY HOOD. <br />
<br />
<b>WHY ARE THEY SO POPULAR?</b> <br />
<br />
I SUSPECT THAT THERE'S A NOMADIC ASSOCIATION THAT APPEALS TO A CULTURE THAT MIGHT BE FEELING A LITTLE OVERCONNECTED AND OVERSATURATED. <br />
<br />
<b>WHAT DO YOU ASSOCIATE HOODIES WITH?</b> <br />
<br />
DIETRICH IN 'THE GARDEN OF ALLAH' AND SNOOP DOGGY DOG. <br />
<br />
<b>DO YOU PREFER A HOODIE WITH A ZIP OR WITHOUT A ZIP AND WHY?</b> <br />
<br />
