# FASHION DAILY NEWS – APRIL 2009
## APRIL 2009

<br><br></p>
<p><b>WHO DID THE DESIGN OF YOUR NEW STORE IN LONDON? HOW WOULD YOU DEFINE THE STYLE OF THIS STORE?</b> <br />
<br />
I WORKED WITH PARISIAN ARCHITECT JOSEPH DIRAND. HE'S AS BIG A FAN AS ARCHITECTURAL RATIONALISM AS I AM, AND I AGREE WITH HIM THAT THE RIGHT MATERIALS PRETTY MUCH TELL THE STORY. <br />
<br />
<b>WHAT ARE YOUR PROJECTS IN TERMS OF INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION? WILL YOU BE OPENING A NEW STORE THIS YEAR? ANY OTHER EXPANSION PLANS OR A NEW LINE, FOR EXAMPLE?</b> <br />
<br />
WE'LL BE OPENING IN TOKYO IN SEPTEMBER. WE ONLY OPEN IN PLACES WHERE WE HAVE A STRONG PARTNERSHIP. PARTNERSHIPS ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN LOCATION FOR US. <br />
<br />
<b>WHAT IS THE SHAREHOLDING OF THE RICK OWENS BRAND? ARE YOU DISCLOSING ANY TURNOVER FIGURES AT ALL?</b> <br />
<br />
