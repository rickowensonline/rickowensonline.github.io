### NOTES

THE SPRING SUMMER COLLECTIONS TITLE IS "VICIOUS" AS IN "VICIOUS, YOU HIT ME WITH A FLOWER" LYRICS FROM THE CHEERFULLY SLEAZY SONG BY LOU REED FROM THE 1970S.
THE VICIOUSNESS I PROPOSE IS ENERGY WITH A WINK. 
LOTS OF BLACK LEATHER - BUT IN THE MOST SIMPLIFIED SHAPES - PARCHMENT LEATHER, TISSUE LEATHER, JUICY LEATHER, DRY LEATHER, HARD LEATHER, LIMP LEATHER.
EVERY LEATHER I COULD FIND.AND OF COURSE THERE IS OUR NEW RUNNER WITH ADIDAS, A TENTATIVE ATTEMPT ON MY PART TO MOTIVATE MYSELF TO DO SOME CARDIO. I WANTED SOMETHING TECHNICALLY SOPHISTICATED SO I WENT TO SOMEONE WHO KNEW WHAT THEY WERE DOING.

### NOTES

THIS RICK OWENS SPRING SUMMER WOMENS COLLECTION IS ABOUT TEAMS AND UNIFORMS. COLLECTIVE SPIRIT AND BONDING. THE SPIRIT OF COMPETITION THAT HAS US ALL BAND INTO TRIBES TO COMPETE. IN FRIENDLY WAYS AND VICIOUS WAYS. TEAMS THAT MIGHT BE EXCLUSIVE OR MIGHT BE INCLUSIVE. 

RUNWAY SHOWS CAN BE ABOUT IMPROBABLE PROPOSALS THIS IS ABOUT WORKING WITH WHAT YOU HAVE. 

SHAPES ARE BASED ON CLASSICAL SHAPES TUNICS, TOGAS, CHITONS AND ARMOR, BUT RENDERED IN THE SIMPLEST AND AIRIEST OF LINES. OUR COLLABORATION WITH ADIDAS PROVIDES A DYNAMIC NOTE WITH OUR LIMITED EDITION RUNNING SHOE. FABRICS INCLUDE TIGHTLY WOVEN COTTONS , RIGID MEGADUCHESSE, AND BOILED SILK TURBOGAZAR. LIGHTWEIGHT WASHED LEATHERS AND SUEDES ARE CUT INTO TUNICS, SHORTS AND JUMPSUITS WE REFER TO IN THE STUDIO AS BODYBAGS. SHORTS AND TUNICS ARE PROPOSED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO A MINIDRESS.
