### NOTES

THIS RICK OWENS FALL WINTER COLLECTION IS CALLED MOODY...., QUIETER AND MORE REFLECTIVE THAN LAST SEASONS VICIOUS CELEBRATION.

WHEN I THINK OF MAKING MENS CLOTHES, I WANT TO SUGGEST DIGNITY, GRAVITY AND CERTAINLY AUTHORITY. 

THIS COLLECTION ALLUDES TO SPIRITUAL AUTHORITY, CAPITAL AUTHORITY AND UNIFORMS THAT SUGGEST AUTHORITY. GANG AUTHORITY, COP AUTHORITY, NUN AUTHORITY. SHAPES ARE REDUCED TO THE SIMPLEST FORM SQUARE BODYSUITS, UNLINED CASHMERE TRENCHES, STRIPPED LEATHER BIKERS AND SEVERELY COLLARED TUNICS. THESE ARE BALANCED ON BOOTS AND SNEAKERS SWOLLEN TO MANGA ROBOT HERO PROPORTIONS. THERE ARE PLENTY OF SIMPLE BLACK HEAVY WOOL BROADCLOTH COATS AND TRENCHES THAT I HOPE LOOK TIMELESS.

THERE WAS A METAL BAND IN THE EIGHTIES CALLED LEATHER NUN THAT DID A DARK AND HEAVY COVER OF ABBA'S "GIMME GIMME GIMME A MAN AFTER MIDNIGHT "....... I THINK THIS COLLECTION MIGHT PARTLY BE ABOUT THAT.......... 

THE MUSIC IS AN EXCLUSIVE REMIX OF HEAVY HEAT , ONE OF RP BOO'S EARLY COMPOSITIONS, HE'S CONSIDERED ONE OF THE ORIGINATORS OF CHICAGO FOOTWORK AND HE AGREED TO DO A NEW REMIX OF IT. IN MY EYES, FOOTWORK TAKES RAP, TECHNO AND HOUSE AND BRINGS IT A CHILLY AUSTERITY BY REPETITIVE SAMPLING AND COMPLEX PERCUSSION. IT SOUNDS MODERN AND PRIMITIVE, RAW, URGENT AND DISORIENTING. SOME OF MY FAVORITE THINGS........
