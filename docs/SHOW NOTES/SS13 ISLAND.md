MEN

Every man is an island with his own set of laws, science and faith.This season I propose crisp clinical skeletons of clothes - almost sketches. 

Cotton organdy, industrial nylons, cotton canvases and leather in every weight and thickness are cut utilitarian shapes with angular seaming. Signature image this Rick Owens spring summer season is a bomber, turtleneck, kilt and clogs.

WOMEN

THIS STORY IS ABOUT THE SERENITY AND CALM WE'RE ALL LOOKING FOR.
THE PURSUIT OF CLEAN RATIONAL LINES AS SATISFYING AS AN OCEAN'S HORIZON. THE QUIET ACCEPTANCE OF SELF THAT COMES TO US EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE IN ISOLATION. RETREAT AND KINDNESS. 

The shoulderline is straight and graphic lines hover over the body like reduced frameworks of a human figure from a cave drawing. Or maybe the lines on an eileen grey laquered screen from the late 1920's.... nylons are tissue thin and dry fast when you come out of the ocean. Signature shapes are bubbles, daggers, mantles and fluid 2 pieces dresses in tissue lambskin. Linear mantles are fastened with hand forged disc clasps that are echoed on the forged metal discs on the high sandals. Colors are copper, sand, flesh, dark shadow with moments of warm silver hammered leather and shiny black python.
